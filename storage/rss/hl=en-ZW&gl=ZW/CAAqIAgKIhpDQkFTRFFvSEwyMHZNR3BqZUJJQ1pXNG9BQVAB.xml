The announcement was made at a meeting of G7 science ministers in Italy after laboratories in Pisa and the US picked up on the tiny vibrations. The findings provide astronomers with an extra dimension of detail on the warping that occurs when two giants of the universe collide. The existence of gravitational waves was first put forward by Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity a century ago.

Predicted by Albert Einstein more than 100 years ago as part of his theory of general relativity, but only detected in 2015, gravitational waves are "ripples" in the fabric of space-time caused by violent processes such as colliding black holes or the collapse of stellar cores. Scientists say the detection of gravitational waves will open a new window on the universe.

The light bulb was an invention with a thousand steps.” In a way, the world’s greatest inventions are oftentimes fraught by even greater adversity.

The issue involved a simple question: where is the atom? Seems easy enough . . . but it’s not. Back in those days, examinations of light gave us two competing views of what it was. Some experiments pointed to light being particles — photons — and each particle could be said as being at a specific point in space. “There it is.

It is assumed, but not experimentally verified, that antimatter masses will behave the same as matter masses in a gravitational field. One of the most astonishing facts about science is how universally applicable the laws of nature are. Every particle obeys the same rules, experiences the same forces, and sees the same fundamental constants, no matter where or when they exist.

The online sale announced Monday by auctioneer Christie's features 22 items from Hawking, including his doctoral thesis on the origins of the universe, some of his many awards, and scientific papers such as "Spectrum of Wormholes" and "Fundamental Breakdown of Physics in Gravitat...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.apnews.com">The Associated Press</source></item><item><title>Wealthy will create ‘superhuman race’: Stephen Hawking essays reveal dark prediction - RT</title><link>https://www.rt.com/news/441230-stephen-hawking-superhuman-race/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPoD3J-ldFFadpJMOWxnF7sqFwgEKg8IACoHCAownP3cAjDQkhww_oMo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 16:37:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/news/441230-stephen-hawking-superhuman-race/" target="_blank"&gt;Wealthy will create ‘superhuman race’: Stephen Hawking essays reveal dark prediction&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;RT&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collection of newly published essays written by Stephen Hawking before his death reveal the iconic physicist believed wealthy people could create a new race of “superhumans” by editing their children’s DNA.

The work, which tackles what theoretical physicists call “the information paradox”, was completed in the days before Hawking’s death in March. It has now been written up by his colleagues at Cambridge and Harvard universities and posted online.

One of the most puzzling and counterintuitive aspects of quantum physics is the apparent link between determinism and measurement. Make a precise measurement of the quantum state of your particle — of its spin, its position, or which slit it went through — and you determine that property exactly. Choose not to make that measurement, and that property is ind...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Physicists Still Aren't Sure Whether Singularities Actually Exist - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/09/27/physicists-still-arent-sure-whether-singularities-actually-exist/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGfkc6PbKFmCJb-253phii4qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 19:28:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/09/27/physicists-still-arent-sure-whether-singularities-actually-exist/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicists Still Aren't Sure Whether Singularities Actually Exist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are physicists undecided about whether the prediction of singularities means they actually exist? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.
