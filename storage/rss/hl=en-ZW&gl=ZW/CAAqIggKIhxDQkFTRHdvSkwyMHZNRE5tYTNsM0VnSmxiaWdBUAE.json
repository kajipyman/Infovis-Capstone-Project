The mission was a success for the most part: the capsule carried by the rocket made it all the way to the International Space Station and dropped off important cargo to the floating lab. But the first stage that flew it there dropped back down with the intention of landing safely on Earth, something it has done successfully more than 30 times. This time around the booster ran into problems as it fell back down to Earth. The feed was cut as SpaceX seemed to realise the attempted landing was going to fail. Bu..."
