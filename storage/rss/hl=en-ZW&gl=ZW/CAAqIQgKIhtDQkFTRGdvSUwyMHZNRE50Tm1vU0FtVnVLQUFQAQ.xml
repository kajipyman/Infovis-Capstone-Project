Security Council has failed to agree on any action on the fighting between Israel and the Hamas militant group in Gaza. Kuwaiti Ambassador Mansour Al-Otaibi told reporters after the closed consultations late Tuesday that "we were not able to find a solution to the situation in Gaza" because of divisions in the most powerful U.N. body.

Palestinian officials said at least three people, including two militants, were killed by Israeli fire and nine were wounded, and an Israeli airstrike destroyed the ruling Hamas group's TV station.

Netanyahu made the remarks in a televised statement on Sunday, after meeting Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, a key coalition partner. The meeting was seen as a last attempt to prevent the collapse of the coalition - which currently has a one-seat majority in parliament - but ended without a conclusion.

Mr Netanyahu’s majority had already been whittled down to a single seat by the resignation of defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who pulled the support of his party after clashing with Mr Netanyahu over how to handle eight months of flare-ups with Hamas.

The exchange was sparked Sunday night, when a team of Israeli reconnaissance troops were discovered inside Gaza.
