In the endless speculation about the direction of the investigation, a common view was that maybe the investigation would never implicate President Trump or find any collusion.

(Reuters) Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was once feted in Western capitals as a new breed of economic and social reformer. Then came the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul on Oct. 2 – and with it, a whirlwind of international controversy and criticism that has engulfed the young Saudi royal. This week, less than two months after the killing of Khashoggi, Mohammed traveled to Buenos Aires for a G20 meeting that brought together leaders from the world's top economies.
