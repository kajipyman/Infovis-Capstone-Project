The Toronto-based firm said in a commentary Wednesday that while global and U.S. oil prices have dropped, Western Canadian producers have been under even "greater duress" as Canadian benchmark prices have fallen even more. Generally, integrated energy companies — those that own refineries and gas stations — have been able to weather the steep price discounts.

The Progressive Conservative leader, who has launched repeated attacks on Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government, said Tuesday that he had no national political ambitions and is committed to leading the province. "I'm zoned in on this province, nothing else," the premier told reporters. "Not federally, nothing but fixing the financial mess that we inherited."
