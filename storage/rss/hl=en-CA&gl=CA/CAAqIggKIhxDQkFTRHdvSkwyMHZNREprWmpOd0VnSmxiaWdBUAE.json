We need Ottawa's full attention. We need them to step up and help us bring an end to this crisis.\" Notley's remarks reflected her frustration over what she thinks is inaction by federal government on getting Alberta crude to the west coast.

That's an increase of more than 36 per cent basically overnight, two nights if you want to be picky about it. It's an increase of nearly 126 per cen..."

The short-term production cuts, permitted under the province's legislation, will take effect on New Year\u2019s Day, the premier said. They will remain in place, dropping over time, until a backlog of about 35 million barrels of already processed oil has been shipped to market, which the government expects to take th..."
