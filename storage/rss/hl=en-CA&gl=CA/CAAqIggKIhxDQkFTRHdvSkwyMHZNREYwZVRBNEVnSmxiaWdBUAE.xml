Nauert, whose nomination requires U.S. Senate confirmation, is a former Fox News Channel correspondent.

The biggest piece of the shifting picture: Chief of Staff John Kelly's departure now appears certain.

Nauert was previously an anchor with Fox News and had little diplomatic or government experience before joining the administration in 2017.

Nauert, 48, was named to replace outgoing ambassador Nikki Haley. How unlucky for us! “She’s very talented, very smart, very quick, and I think she’s going to be respected by all,” Donald Trump said on Friday morning. Nauert, who most recently served as the State Department’s spokeswoman, like virtually every other Trump appointee, has no relevant experience for the job, and has a long history of saying racist things.

The new allegations come as the U.S. ramps up pressure on Iran to halt what it calls "malign activities" in the Middle East and elsewhere by reinstating sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal from which President Donald Trump withdrew in May.
