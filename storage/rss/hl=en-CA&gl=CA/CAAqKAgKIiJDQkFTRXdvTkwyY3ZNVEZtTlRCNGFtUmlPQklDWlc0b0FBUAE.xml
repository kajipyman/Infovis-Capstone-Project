But while I loved the Switch from the moment Nintendo released it in March 2017, I also warned off all but the most ardent fans: For $300, there just wasn’t enough to play. By the 2017 holiday season, Nintendo and its partners had filled that void, releasing a swath of games that made the console a must-buy for many. But discounts were still few and far between.

The four-player fighting game lets players take control of more than 70 different characters from across Nintendo’s vast library of games, as well as a few from outside it, as well. Nintendo confirmed last week that the game would also get five still-unnamed fighters after launch. Each can be purchased individually for $5.99, or all of them can be bought as a set for $25.

If you missed the epic World of Light trailer (shown below) it results in Kirby surviving the annihilation of his Super Smash Bros. allies and forced to fix the world alone. Considering that the series started back with HAL Laboratory in 1999 for the N64 and that Masahiro Sakurai has helmed the games in the series since, the fact Kirby has been singled out like this should not be all that surprising.
