When Angela Merkel let more than 800,000 refugees into the country in the summer of 2015, few could have predicted the fall-out that would follow. Over the past three years, her government has been embroiled in bitter political infighting and the surge in support for right-wing policies and the populist party Alternative for Deutschland (AFD) has led commentators to question just how much this decision led to her departure.

The land down under has cycled through five PMs since 2013. Morrison, who became Australia’s 30th prime minister in August, had his debut meeting with the German chancellor at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. But before the diplomatic pleasantries began, Merkel was spotted reviewing a briefing about Morrison – complete with a photograph – as the Australian leader sat next to her. @ellinghausen captures Merkel rea...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rt.com">RT</source></item><item><title>Merkel busted checking 'cheat sheet' with photo of Australian PM at G20 meeting - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/angela-merkel-cheat-sheet-australia-prime-minister-scott-morrison-g20-summit-a8664761.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEP48PthtmWU-efOCzJKQdZYqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCtyxU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 13:17:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/angela-merkel-cheat-sheet-australia-prime-minister-scott-morrison-g20-summit-a8664761.html" target="_blank"&gt;Merkel busted checking 'cheat sheet' with photo of Australian PM at G20 meeting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela Merkel was captured reading a crib sheet of factual notes about Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, as the pair sat down together at the G20 summit in Argentina at the weekend. The German chancellor’s briefing notes contained a brief biography and photograph of Mr Morrison – Australia’s fifth prime minister since 2013 – in case she struggled for basic details about him. The Liberal Party leader took office in August this year after his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, was forced out by party rivals. Australian media reacted with amusement at the idea the German chancellor neede...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Who is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer?

As she was installed as the new leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union yesterday, she wasted no time in delivering that message. While paying a heartfelt tribute to her political sponsor, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer - or AKK as she is universally known - also warned that she wouldn’t be the comfortable partner to Mrsk Merkel that many have been assuming.

Ms Merkel was not alone in her bewilderment. Her G20 counterparts were also struggling to keep up with the brutal “revolving door” leadership culture that characterises recent politics Down Under, where there have been five prime ministers in five years. Donald Trump was more direct when he met Mr Morrison, who replaced Malcolm Turnbull following a leadership coup in August. He simply asked Mr Morrison what had happen...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item></channel></rss>
