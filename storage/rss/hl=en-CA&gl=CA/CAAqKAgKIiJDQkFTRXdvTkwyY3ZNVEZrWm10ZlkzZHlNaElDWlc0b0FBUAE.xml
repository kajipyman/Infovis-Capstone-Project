In a sentencing memo filed in the case against Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Mueller notes topics about which Cohen has provided information.

In court filings that revealed details of how Michael Cohen has helped the Russia investigation, prosecutors also detailed a previously unknown attempt by a Russian to help the Trump campaign. Prosecutors in New York asked a judge to sentence Cohen to a "substantial term of imprisonment" for paying an adult film star hush money on Mr Trump's behalf, and for evading taxes. Cohen pleaded guilty to the charges in August.
