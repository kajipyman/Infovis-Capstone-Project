Xi's visit comes two years after the maverick Duterte declared he was reorienting his foreign policy away from longtime ally the United States and towards China, despite decades of mistrust and bitter maritime disputes with Beijing.

But it is unlikely that Ms. Marcos, a 89-year-old widow, will see any jail time.
