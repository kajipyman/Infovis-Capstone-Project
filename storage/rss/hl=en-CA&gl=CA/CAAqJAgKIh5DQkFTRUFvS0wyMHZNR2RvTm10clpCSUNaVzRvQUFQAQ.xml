The Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), an upstart political party that was sworn into power on Thursday, has promised to propose legislation that prevents teachers, police officers, judges and certain other government employees from wearing religious items such as hijabs, kippas, crucifixes and turbans.

I followed it from afar but with a lot of interest and a certain dose of skepticism. Since arriving in Canada and living in Montreal in the early 1990s, I found that during provincial and even federal elections, the question of Quebec independence occupied a big portion of the political debate. Usually Quebec independence came as a final threat launched by the "federalist" Parti Libéral du Québec (PLQ) to dissuade the last batch of hesitant voters from siding with the "sovereigntist" Parti Québécois (PQ).

It was federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on the line — and he wanted to be the first. ​Legault's Coalition Avenir Quebec party doesn't have formal ties to Scheer's party. Conservatives still might have the most to gain from Legault's triumph. Both parties support lower taxes. Both want tighter controls on immigration and are willing to play identity politics for electoral gain. Both would share the view that the new North American trade ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cbc.ca">CBC News</source></item><item><title>Quebec election: CAQ tries to crack western Quebec in final push - CBC News</title><link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/quebec-election-caq-tries-to-crack-west-quebec-in-final-push-1.4842931</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEL1baUbUtx0WRh17Vo7IqdgqFggEKg4IACoGCAowqKNmMKjdCjCT1B0</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 10:58:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/quebec-election-caq-tries-to-crack-west-quebec-in-final-push-1.4842931" target="_blank"&gt;Quebec election: CAQ tries to crack western Quebec in final push&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CBC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the final campaign push began this weekend, the Coalition Avenir Québec candidates in the five ridings of West Quebec held a news conference in Gatineau with a message for anyone who wants change in the region. "You have a unique chance on Monday to end 40 years of Liberal reign here in the Outaouais," said the CAQ candidate in the Papineau riding, Mathieu Lacombe. "The Liberal MNAs in West Quebec, we have to say, have betrayed the region for too long," Lacombe said, suggesting the region's voters would be better served with CAQ MNAs in a CAQ government.

With his wife Suzanne Pilote, by his side, Couillard stood at a podium in the lobby of Quebec's parliament building and told reporters he is leaving the province in a much better state than it was in when he came to power. But he said after putting all his energy into public service, staying in politics, in any role, would be "more than I feel I am humanly capable of."

François Legault would also move swiftly to reduce the number of immigrants allowed into the province by 20 per cent. He made the comments Tuesday, at his first news conference since his Coalition Avenir Québec won a decisive majority in Monday's provincial election, beating out the incumbent Liberals.
