"I want to be clear. This is a short-term measure,'' Notley said on Sunday. "We are essentially giving our oil away for free ... this is not sustainable." Notley said production of raw crude oil and bitumen will be reduced by 8.7 per cent — or 325,000 barrels per day — in January because of shipment problems that she blames on a lack of pipelines.
