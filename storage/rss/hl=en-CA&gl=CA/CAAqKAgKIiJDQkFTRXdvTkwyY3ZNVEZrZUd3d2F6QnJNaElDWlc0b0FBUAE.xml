Sometimes it's "I was on set, and my manager called." Most of the time, because the noms are announced around 5:00 a.m. PT, it's "I was asleep, and my manager called." For Cardi B, who received five nominations, it was something entirely different. The Bronx born rapper went to court this Friday after a judge reportedly threatened to issue a bench warrant for her arrest. Cardi was released without bail. On her way out of the courthouse, a photographer told her that she'd been nominated for a Grammy. ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.refinery29.com">Refinery29</source></item><item><title>Grammy nominations 2019: Cardi B, Kendrick Lamar and Drake lead the pack - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/grammy-nominations-2019-cardi-b-kendrick-lamar-drake-lead</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEIlVuvKfjcfFvCwBWElA-EUqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTCOvRU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 16:31:33 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/grammy-nominations-2019-cardi-b-kendrick-lamar-drake-lead" target="_blank"&gt;Grammy nominations 2019: Cardi B, Kendrick Lamar and Drake lead the pack&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;After controversy about the Grammys’ failure to recognise women’s achievements at the 2018 ceremony, female artists dominate key categories in the nominations for the 2019 awards.

The occasion marked a milestone for City Girls, a Florida-based duo made up of the rappers JT and Yung Miami. The pair released their second album of 2018, “Girl Code,” even though JT is currently sitting in a federal prison in Tallahassee. The ascent of the City Girls is one of the most unlikely success stories of the past months.

Bronx rapper Cardi B became the new queen of hip-hop, holding the unwavering attention of both critics and tabloids.

For the BBC, she wrote with passion about an issue she’s championed for much of her career: the impossible beauty standards that shape how the world sees women (and how women see themselves). This time, though, Jamil made a particularly bold claim—that airbrushing images should be not just discouraged, but also illegal: “I think it’s a disgusting tool that has been weaponised, predominantly against women, and is responsible for so many more problems than we realise because we are blinded by the media, our culture, and...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theatlantic.com">The Atlantic</source></item><item><title>The Grammys' Big 4 Are Full Of POC — But I'm Still Side Eyeing Them - Refinery29</title><link>https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/218879/grammys-2019-nominees-general-category-diversity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEI3Niu6DVeHrC-7nHCJAC_4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowqOXeCjDQ5dYBMJ3T0QM</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:10:44 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/218879/grammys-2019-nominees-general-category-diversity" target="_blank"&gt;The Grammys' Big 4 Are Full Of POC — But I'm Still Side Eyeing Them&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Refinery29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all of the traditional award shows — Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, Tonys — the Grammys are by far the most interesting to watch.

Plus, an opportunity to catch a performance from the likes of Beyoncé or Childish Gambino is always a yes for me.

The rapper sported long, rainbow streaked hair and a skin-tight black dress at 24/7 ultra-club E11EVEN MIAMI on Wednesday night. When the DJ played her hits, including "Bodak Yellow" and "Drippin," which features her ex, Offset, Cardi B grabbed the microphone and sang along.

In a recent Guardian interview, she said: Do you believe that little flies or butterflies or something can be old souls, people that you knew? I have this little fly that comes near me all the time.

Nominations will be announced Friday, but it was reported months ago that the pair had been knocked out of new-artist contention -- Cardi, because her nominations last year disqualified her, and Post Malone, because Recording Academy voters reportedly decided he didn't fit the requirements for new artists.
