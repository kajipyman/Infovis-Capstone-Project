There did not seem to be a majority ready to make that move. The Constitution’s double jeopardy clause generally forbids subsequent prosecutions. But the Supreme Court has made one exception.

The court has never established a standard to resolve extreme partisan gerrymanders, and if it chooses to do so, it could revolutionize the way congressional and state legislative maps are drawn.

Decades ago, the Supreme Court developed an exception to the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy clause and it is now being asked to rethink precedent.

The State Legislature decided that people facing less than six months in jail would have their cases decided by a single judge rather than a jury. That law has had the unintended effect of depriving immigrants in the city of jury trials for crimes like prostitution and harassment, even though they face the stiff punishment of deportation if convicted, advocates for immigrants said.

Today (Nov. 26), the US Supreme Court is considering whether app store users can sue Apple under federal antitrust law for monopolizing the iPhone app marketplace, prompting high prices for products. The iPhone users in Apple v. Pepper (pdf) argue that the company’s single-market sales system drives up app prices—and that Apple is responsible for the markup, even though developers are the ones who decide how much their apps should c...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://qz.com">Quartz</source></item><item><title>Kavanaugh And Gorsuch Confirmations Force Progressives To Rethink The Supreme Court - HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-kavanaugh-gorsuch_us_5bf806e3e4b0771fb6b8489a</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENMnWcwfh0eQ2DCOqgSeDskqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowxYgCMIBNMOGXAg</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 16:07:57 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-kavanaugh-gorsuch_us_5bf806e3e4b0771fb6b8489a" target="_blank"&gt;Kavanaugh And Gorsuch Confirmations Force Progressives To Rethink The Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and Republicans’ 2016 stonewalling of Merrick Garland have upended liberals’ view of the Supreme Court as a protector of key constitutional rights. Now, progressives are starting to talk about how to challenge the power of the sitting Supreme Court. The issues under discussion range from process reforms like ending lifetime appointments and enacting recusal and ethics laws to stripping the court of jurisdiction and retaking “stolen” seats.
