Google’s new Pixel Slate tablet, which starts at $599, represents the culmination of those efforts.

Today, as a result of Google's ongoing investigation into the situation, it has discovered three malicious ad network SDKs that were being used to conduct of ad fraud in these apps. The company is now emailing developers who have these SDKs installed in their apps, and demanding their removal. Otherwise, the developers' apps will be pulled from Google Play, as well.

The company was in the midst of an unprecedented emergency. In October, its core systems, which crawled the Web to build an “index” of it, had stopped working. Although users could still type in queries at google.com, the results they received were five months out of date. More was at stake than the engineers realized. Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were negotiating a deal to power a search engine for Yahoo, and they’d promised to deliver an index ten times bigger than the one they ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.newyorker.com">The New Yorker</source></item><item><title>How Google and Morse code are helping to make gaming more inclusive - Fast Company</title><link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90276135/how-google-and-morse-code-are-helping-to-make-gaming-more-inclusive</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPIQiN-cS7ohZaCFEa3oSW8qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowlacCMKBPMOGbAg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 10:47:08 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90276135/how-google-and-morse-code-are-helping-to-make-gaming-more-inclusive" target="_blank"&gt;How Google and Morse code are helping to make gaming more inclusive&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has teamed up with the clever folks at Adaptive Design Association—an organization that builds custom adaptations for children with disabilities—for a 48-hour hackathon to design prototype games that turned learning Morse code into fun.
