I wouldn’t say I had given up entirely; it’s far too soon to make any such grandiose claims. I didn’t even make an especially conscious commitment to quit, it just sort of happened. The truth is, I was in Tokyo, where the act of inhaling nicotine is made so impossibly difficult and unpleasant that even I couldn’t be bothered — and I speak as someone who has frequently sheltered under scaffolding during snow blizzards to get my fix.

But as 2018 went on, even more states ended up changing their laws to allow for legal recreational or medical cannabis use despite the conflict with federal law. Efforts to end national prohibition in Congress picked up steam as well.
