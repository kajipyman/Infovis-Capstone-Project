Slides on the south-facing side of the playground are getting so heated that they reportedly singed a child. The play structure was opened just two years ago on St. Patrick's Island, but now it's closed for the $100,000 renovation. Shades had been installed to keep the metal cool, but they ended up being used as hammocks.

It's industry standard for flight attendants' pay to be based on the time from wheels up to wheels down, although most airlines also provide some compensation for the time flight attendants spend at airports before and after flights. WestJet does not, and it's become a sticking point with flight attendants as minimum wages rise across the country.
