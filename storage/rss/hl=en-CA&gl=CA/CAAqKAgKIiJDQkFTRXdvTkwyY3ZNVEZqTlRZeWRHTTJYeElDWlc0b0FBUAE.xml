Montreal had been due to host a double-header season finale in late-July, but city mayor Valérie Plante announced it would either be relocated to the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve or scrapped altogether, due to unpaid bills. With the former not an option due to scheduled construction work for a new Formula 1 pit and paddock complex, Plante had no other option but to cancel the race, forcing Formula E bo...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.motorsportweek.com">Motorsport Week</source></item><item><title>Pit Bull Restrictions Lifted in Montreal as New Mayor Makes Good on Pledge - The New York Times</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/world/americas/pit-bull-ban-montreal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEFg2MdwFLcXbOT8kYnB3KVcqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowjuuKAzCWrzww5oEY</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 13:41:27 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/world/americas/pit-bull-ban-montreal.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pit Bull Restrictions Lifted in Montreal as New Mayor Makes Good on Pledge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A controversial 2016 bylaw stopped new pit bull adoptions in the city and imposed a fee on owners.

She and her team are a big reason why baseball became an election issue. And her win is the reason the sport is still in the headlines now.

A club of exclusively white Christian men has been elected (for a while solely by other white Christian men) to run the city of Montreal in an unbroken chain since 1833.
