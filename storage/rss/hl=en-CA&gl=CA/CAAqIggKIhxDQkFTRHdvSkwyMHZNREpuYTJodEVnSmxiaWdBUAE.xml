More Americans die from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in the winter months than during any other time of year, suggests a study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. About 45,000 Americans are treated for CO poisoning each year, and about 1,600 die, says Eric Lavonas, M.D., chief of emergency medicine at Denver Health. Carbon monoxide is produced when fossil fuels are burned.
