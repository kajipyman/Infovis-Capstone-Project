For some, however, watching Lance Armstrong cameo in an HBO mockumentary about drugs in cycling will have been too much too soon.

Just reading its IMDB description — "Jake Peralta, an immature but talented NYPD detective in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct, comes into immediate conflict with his new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Ray Holt" — makes it difficult to hold back an eye roll. But the show is actually hilarious, and it's because of its stellar and diverse cast. Melissa Fumero, who plays Amy Santiago on the show, talked to Us Weekly about the show's diversity.
