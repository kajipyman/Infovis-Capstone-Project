The group has officially requested that the town’s mayor steps in and renames it ‘Rue de la Soycisse’ after soy, a common ingredient in vegan meals.

From likening rape survivors to pigs and cows, to calling Pokémon a form of animal cruelty, PETA's efforts to “save the animals” always make the headlines—and with good reason: they're completely absurd. The animal rights group today released a new video to cry over milk, equating the nutritious drink with Nazism.
