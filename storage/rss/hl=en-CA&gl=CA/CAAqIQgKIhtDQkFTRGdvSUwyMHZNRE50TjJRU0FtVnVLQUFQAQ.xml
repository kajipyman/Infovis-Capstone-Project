They were not directed so much at Hezbollah, Israel’s archenemy to the north: Few Israelis were completely surprised at their government’s assertion that the group had dug tunnels under the Lebanese border. Residents there have complained of strange sounds at night for years. Instead, the distrust was directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who recently assumed the additional role of defense minister, and who is facing increasing legal woes.
