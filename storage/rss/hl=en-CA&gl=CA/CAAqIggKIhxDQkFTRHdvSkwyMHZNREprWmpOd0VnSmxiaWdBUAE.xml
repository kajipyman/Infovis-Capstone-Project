No problem. The lack of a firm answer about requested help from the federal government won't stop Alberta Premier Rachel Notley from demanding a solution to her province's oil crisis. It's far from her ideal outcome. But during the first ministers meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and some of cabinet in Montreal on Friday, Notley said she felt the door open slightly — giving her confidence in continuing the fight. "We're going to keep doing the work that we have been doing," she told CBC Radio's The House after coming up empty-handed on a deal with Ottawa.

The one sour note was sounded by Ontario's Progressive Conservative premier, Doug Ford, who accused Trudeau of moving the goalposts on Canada's climate-change plans, requiring Ontario to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions more than Ford had expected. But other premiers, including fellow Conservative Brian Pallister from Manitoba, disputed Ford's interpretation of what the prime minister said beh...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca">HuffPost Canada</source></item><item><title>Trudeau open to rail car purchase, more generous EI rules to help struggling energy sector - CBC News</title><link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-rail-cars-oil-notley-1.4935419</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPGd9_SkfWN2F3XtnNByR0gqFggEKg4IACoGCAowqKNmMKjdCjCT1B0</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 22:15:11 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-rail-cars-oil-notley-1.4935419" target="_blank"&gt;Trudeau open to rail car purchase, more generous EI rules to help struggling energy sector&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CBC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he is willing to consider helping Alberta Premier Rachel Notley fund the purchase of rail cars to increase the volume of oil her province can ship to international markets.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is bracing for a barrage of criticism from premiers upset about the federal approach to pipelines, carbon taxation, environmental assessments, GM's Oshawa plant closure in Ontario and the oil price crisis — none of which are specifically on the agenda.

Western Canada Select (WCS), the benchmark for heavy oil in Alberta, continues to trade below $15 per barrel, or roughly $40-per-barrel lower than WTI. That is a hefty discount, although slightly narrower than the $50 per barrel discount WCS traded for a few weeks ago. “It’s worth more in the ground than it is to produce it right now,” Athabasca Oil Corp. CEO Rob Broen said in an interview Wednesday with BNN Bloomberg Television...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rt.com">RT</source></item><item><title>Oil price woes a 'serious problem' for Canadian economy, says Notley - CBC News</title><link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/notley-oil-cuts-1.4907701</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGKEmFwoPNdFpkmwoduuxFEqFggEKg4IACoGCAowqKNmMKjdCjDBjx0</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:36:05 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/notley-oil-cuts-1.4907701" target="_blank"&gt;Oil price woes a 'serious problem' for Canadian economy, says Notley&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CBC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says the low price of western Canadian crude has become a serious problem for the country's economy, adding her government is "furiously" seeking solutions. But while the province and the oilpatch explore their options, Notley said there's a lack of agreement around the sector on the controversial call for her government to mandate temporary production cuts. Though the province has an obligation to look at everything, she said, they also want to explore solutions where they might find more consensus with similar results.

A shortage of pipeline capacity is contributing to a huge gap between the price for Canadian crude and the American benchmark, costing some companies and the provincial government dearly.
