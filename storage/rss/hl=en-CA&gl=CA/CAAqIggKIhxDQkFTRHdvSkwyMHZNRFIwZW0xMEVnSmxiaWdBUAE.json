MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Lawmakers sparred in sharp, angry tones. Furious demonstrators drowned out cheery Christmas carols being sung by schoolchildren. Visitors were cleared from a Capitol gallery, escorted away as they chanted: \u201cShame! Shame!

But before Democrats can take their place next year, GOP lawmakers in both states are moving to strip the incoming leaders of key powers.

If the bills pass Wisconsin's Republican-led Assembly and Senate, and lame-duck Gov. Scott Walker sig..."

The most intense battle is playing out in Wisconsin, where Republican lawmakers are attempting a power grab that would strip key functions from the state\u2019s incoming Democratic governor and attorney general.
