Nicki Minaj and Cardi B’s feud has everything: a physical altercation in couture gowns; the alleged leaking of private phone numbers on the internet; a 10-part Instagram saga; an odd call for a truce. The only thing missing from this clash of rap titans is an actual rap song, but that’s hardly necessary in our current era of social media-driven feuds. The latest chapter in the now year-old squabble began o...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.vox.com">Vox.com</source></item><item><title>Long A Team Player, Migos' Takeoff Lands His First Solo Hot 100 Hit - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2018/11/06/takeoff-billboard/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJ2901GMH-QbLRDSus0GdWQqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMJGBAg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2018 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2018/11/06/takeoff-billboard/" target="_blank"&gt;Long A Team Player, Migos' Takeoff Lands His First Solo Hot 100 Hit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Photo by Prince Williams/ Getty Images) As part of the trap trio Migos with Offset and Quavo, Takeoff boasts more than two dozen Billboard charting songs. This week, however, the Atlanta rapper reaches a new career milestone with “Last Memory,” his first solo single to chart on the Hot 100. Produced by MonstaBeatz, the track debuts there at No. 54. It also claims No. 18 on On-Demand Streaming Songs, No. 23 on Hot Rap Songs and No. 25 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The lead single off Takeoff’s just-released album debut The Last Rocket, “Last Memory” marks his second solo appearance on the Hot 1...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Takeoff – ‘The Last Rocket’ review - NME Live</title><link>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/takeoff-last-rocket-review</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPQ87LeKNKluroqgl6sCDNAqFggEKg4IACoGCAow_598MLC1CTDingY</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2018 16:17:37 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/takeoff-last-rocket-review" target="_blank"&gt;Takeoff – ‘The Last Rocket’ review&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;NME Live&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Migos underdog proves his worth on this eclectic, engaging – and often emotionally bare – collection Takeoff Depending on who you ask, Takeoff is either the most underrated or least distinctive member of Migos. After all, the 24-year-old has been notably absent from two of the Atlanta trio’s biggest musical moments to date: their 2016 megahit ‘Bad and Boujee’ (although Takeoff will always dispute the notion that he missed out on that one; see his heavily-memed quote “do it look like I’m left off ‘Bad and Boujee’?”) and Calvin Harris’ ‘Slide’, the chart-slaying collaboration with Frank O...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nme.com">NME Live</source></item><item><title>Halsey And Wes Scheck Land Top 10 Hits Behind Maroon 5 And Cardi B's Massive No. 1 - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/11/05/halsey-and-wes-scheck-land-top-10-hits-behind-maroon-5-and-cardi-bs-massive-no-1/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEARoYLsoxylSXi2_qhkgdZkqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMJGBAg</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2018 21:08:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/11/05/halsey-and-wes-scheck-land-top-10-hits-behind-maroon-5-and-cardi-bs-massive-no-1/" target="_blank"&gt;Halsey And Wes Scheck Land Top 10 Hits Behind Maroon 5 And Cardi B's Massive No. 1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;US singer Halsey performs during the MTV Europe Music Awards at the Bizkaia Arena in the northern Spanish city of Bilbao on November 4, 2018.

For those not attuned to the ongoings between the two, here's a breakdown of what went down before the duo called an unexpected truce. The tension between Cardi and Minaj appeared to first surfaced in March 2017 when the "Barbie Tingz" hitmaker reportedly liked a post that mocked the rising talent's rapping style, according to Glamour. Minaj then seemingly slammed Cardi on Katy Perry's "Swish Swish" upon rapping, "Silly rap beefs just get me more checks/ My life is a movie, I...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.newsweek.com">Newsweek</source></item><item><title>Cardi B and Nicki Minaj Are Having a Night - Jezebel</title><link>https://themuse.jezebel.com/cardi-b-and-nicki-minaj-are-having-a-night-1830088103</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOpVbkbYLQxS5DZVVwtMLuQqFggEKg0IACoGCAowlYECMLFMMIfvngY</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 03:25:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://themuse.jezebel.com/cardi-b-and-nicki-minaj-are-having-a-night-1830088103" target="_blank"&gt;Cardi B and Nicki Minaj Are Having a Night&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Jezebel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: via Getty Nicki Minaj and Cardi B’s beef is so good I’m starting to suspect it’s marketing for a new collab or something. On Monday night, Variety reported that Minaj addressed her ageless feud with Cardi on her Beats 1 Queen Radio show, claiming, among other things, that Cardi tried to sabotage her career by blocking Offset and 21 Savage from working with her; that she didn’t leak Cardi’s phone number; and, most importantly, that it was her friend Rah Ali who “really, really beat Cardi’s ass bad” at a Harper’s Bazaar fashion week party last month, not security. “You went home and to...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://themuse.jezebel.com">Jezebel</source></item><item><title>How Long Has This Nicki Minaj &amp; Cardi B Feud Been Going On?

The Cardi B and Nicki Minaj drama reached a fever pitch when the nearly year-long feud culminated in a public fight last week in New York City. Following the fight, the women continued throwing stones at one other, with Cardi (née Belcalis Almanzar), 25, and Minaj (née Onika Maraj), 35, taking swipes on Instagram and the radio, respectively. But how did this even start? When did their conflict begin? I wrote a poem to sum up the 1,000 words ahead: "Cardi B came on the scene, said 'Nicki hold my beer.' Nicki glared, and fumed, and yelled, 'Bitch, I'm still ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.refinery29.com">Refinery29</source></item></channel></rss>
