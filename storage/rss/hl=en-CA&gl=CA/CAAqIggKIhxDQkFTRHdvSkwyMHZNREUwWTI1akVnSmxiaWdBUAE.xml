Timothy Piazza, a 19-year-old sophomore, died on February 4, 2017 after drinking copious amounts of alcohol in his first night of pledging the Beta Theta Pi chapter, which was later shuttered by the national fraternity and permanently banned by the university. The fraternity was supposed to be alcohol free. The settlement, which was announced Tuesday, includes an undisclosed monetary sum and reforms, s...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item><item><title>French government defends heavy-handed police tactics against students - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-protests-students/french-government-defends-heavy-handed-police-tactics-against-students-idUSKBN1O61CI</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELmesR1xPMM_ay9rEYbmlxkqFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMLT5lwM</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 12:38:51 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-protests-students/french-government-defends-heavy-handed-police-tactics-against-students-idUSKBN1O61CI" target="_blank"&gt;French government defends heavy-handed police tactics against students&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's government on Friday defended the tactics of riot police who forced several dozen detained high-school students to kneel in rows with their hands held behind their heads or in handcuffs after violent protests west of Paris. Students this week have been blocking access to scores of high schools across France in protest at President Emmanuel Macron's education reforms, just as the 40-year-old leader grapples with sometimes-violent demonstrations over living costs.

Chinese students offered a new, steady source of tuition revenue and smart, able students. They diversified universities tuition revenue, but over time they began to become a larger, and larger share of it. Only 4% of student visas, just under 12,000, went to citizens of Mainland China in 1997. But as the market opened, and China’s middle class grew and prospered, many more Chinese students wanted and could afford to study in America. By 2015 more than 40%, or 600,00, of student visas were issued to stude...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://qz.com">Quartz</source></item><item><title>Help paying off your student loans is a great perk–if you can get it - Fast Company</title><link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90272438/help-paying-off-your-student-loans-is-a-great-perk-if-you-can-get-it</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEB7okd2xz7VaDDo8FtO-8dcqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowlacCMKBPMOGbAg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 10:00:29 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90272438/help-paying-off-your-student-loans-is-a-great-perk-if-you-can-get-it" target="_blank"&gt;Help paying off your student loans is a great perk–if you can get it&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, Joe Lakier, then 25, wasn’t really thinking about his student loans. After graduating from law school three years earlier, he was stuck making monthly payments on $100,000 worth of loans, and wasn’t even beginning to chip away at the principal. But Lakier qualified for a federal student loan forgiveness program. “The plan was, I would wait 20 years and if I made those minimum payments, the rest would be forgiven,” he remembers. His employer at the time, Ernst &amp; Young, had recently begun offering a discount on student loan refinancing as part of its employee benefits package.
