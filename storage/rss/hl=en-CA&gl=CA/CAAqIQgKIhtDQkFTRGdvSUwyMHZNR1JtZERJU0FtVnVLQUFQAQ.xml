The video focuses on buses, particularly downtown and bus rapid transit (BRT) routes, which have improved markedly and now carry many more people than they used to.

Trudeau will make the announcement at a 9 a.m. news conference at the O-Train Belfast Yard maintenance and storage facility, along with Mayor Jim Watson. Earlier this year, Ottawa city council pushed ahead with Phase 2 of LRT, a $3.6-billion project that will see the system currently under construction extended east to Trim Road, west to Moodie Drive and south to Bowesville by 2023. The price tag includes various add-ons, including widening Highway 417.

It passes through the inside of a 19-story residential high-rise every single day, according to People's Daily.

As it uncovers the causes for the popular failure of the streetcar systems in cities such as Washington DC, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City (low speed and limited connectivity, mostly) it asks why an increasing number of American city governments are pushing for streetcars in spite of...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.archdaily.com">ArchDaily</source></item><item><title>MYS Architects Designs Tel Aviv High-Rise with Environmental-Ornamental Brise-Soleil - ArchDaily</title><link>http://www.archdaily.com/870610/mys-architects-designs-tel-aviv-high-rise-with-environmental-ornamental-brise-soleil</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGfvrMApn3GjlljN3wFh6w4qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowkLQGMJBaMK-8Ag</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.archdaily.com/870610/mys-architects-designs-tel-aviv-high-rise-with-environmental-ornamental-brise-soleil" target="_blank"&gt;MYS Architects Designs Tel Aviv High-Rise with Environmental-Ornamental Brise-Soleil&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ArchDaily&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of MYS Architects MYS Architects has been selected to design a new mixed-use high-rise in the northern business district of Tel Aviv, an area home to the city’s urban skyscraper belt.

The first option travels from Civic around Capital Circle and onto Adelaide Avenue, while the second instead detours through Barton. The Government encouraged Canberrans to have their say on the options. Both require tracks to be laid across Commonwealth Avenue bridge, although exactly what that would look li...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item></channel></rss>
