The Oscars have a longstanding host problem, but Kevin Hart's swift downfall over old anti-gay tweets has led to bigger questions about the gig and the liability of social media histories.

On Thursday (Nov. 6) night, Kevin Hart announced that he was stepping down from his hosting gig at the 2019 Academy Awards, less than two days after he was initially announced.
