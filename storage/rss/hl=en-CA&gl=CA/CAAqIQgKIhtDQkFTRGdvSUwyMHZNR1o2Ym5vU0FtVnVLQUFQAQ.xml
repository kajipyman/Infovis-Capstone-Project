Twenty-nine years ago, a man entered a packed classroom at l'École Polytechnique, the engineering school at l'Université de Montréal. He told all the men to leave the room. "J'haïs les féministes," he said to the women who were forced to remain: "I hate feminists."

Last year in the city, there was only one homicide on record, and the murder before that came some 16 months prior, which might help explain why the people of Quebec City were so badly shaken Monday in the wake of the rampage at a mosque on Sunday.

On that day in 1989, a lone gunman entered a classroom of 60 engineering students and ordered the men to leave.

But on rare occasions, a tragic moment will come along and propel the issue to the top of the public agenda. When that happens, the country abandons the decibel range of polite discourse and begins to argue—loudly—about gun control. That’s what happened this week after a lone gunman, Faisal Hussein, allegedly opened fire in Toronto’s Danforth neighborhood Sunday night, killing two and wounding 13 more.

The term "incel" is short for "involuntary celibate," an online community of men who say they want to have sex but have been rejected by women.
