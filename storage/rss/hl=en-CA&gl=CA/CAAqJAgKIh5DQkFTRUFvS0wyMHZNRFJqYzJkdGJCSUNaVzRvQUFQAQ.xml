The OnePlus 6T bears several similarities to other high-end phones from Vivo and Oppo, which are also owned by parent company BBK, but don’t have wireless carrier deals. Most notably, it has a fingerprint reader built into the display glass–a first for the U.S. market–and just a small camera cutout near the top of the 6.41-inch screen.

The new chipset is called the Snapdragon 675 and it focuses on delivering a better gaming experience on Android smartphones, as well as support for triple-camera setups. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 may be the successor to the 670, but it has a few downgraded specs. The new chipset is constructed with an 11nm process instead of 10nm.

(Photo: Liang Shuang/Huanqiu.com/VCG via Getty Images) Xiaomi’s original Mi Mix, released in the fall of 2016, was an industry shaker that ditched several traditional smartphone hardware parts and ignored conventional design cues to achieve its at the time near-bezel-less look. Of course, the competition for jaw-dropping design has gotten much stiffer in 2018, a fact even Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun admitted during yesterday’s launch event of the Mi Mix 3.

Samsung didn’t provide specific details about the Galaxy A8s, but it did say that the handset will come with a “first-time adoption” technology, according to Phone Arena. Samsung then showed a teaser image of what the Galaxy A8s might look like and it appears the device will have little to no bezels on all sides.

Last October, Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission fined American chip developer Qualcomm NT$23.4 billion ($774 million). The commission found that Qualcomm had used its dominant position in the modem chip market to charge unfair royalties and terms for its patents.

The Snapdragon Wear 3100 was built from the ground up and isn’t simply a repurposed version of Qualcomm’s smartphone chipsets.

The new chip–Qualcomm’s first for smartwatches in more than two years–adds a power-efficient co-processor, which allows the screen to always display the time in up to 16 colors, with a smoothly scrolling second hand and live complications.

That price war is still going strong three years on. In fact, it may be more irrational than ever.

Its premium smartphone market share is up, too, so it’s more than Huawei selling just cheap phones, and based on Moor Insights &amp; Strategy analyst Anshel Sag’s analysis, the company has the best smartphone camera at this moment with the P20 Pro.
