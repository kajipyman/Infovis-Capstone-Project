But for all the drama in Los Angeles, Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury’s eagerly-anticipated heavyweight world title fight ended in a controversial draw. The British challenger boxed what seemed to be a perfect game plan up until being put on the canvas in the ninth, before a second knockdown followed in the 12th round.

Speaking ahead of fight week, Fury said he is particularly motivated to win on Wilder's home turf. "I'm hoping it is going to be the biggest fight of my life, that's what I'm preparing for.

Stevenson (28-1, 23 KOs) is one of the best light heavyweights in the world – even if he doesn’t fight often enough for us to remember it on a consistent basis – and he dominated Fonfara for long stretches of the fight when the two first matched up in 2014. Stevenson is also a -1100 betting favorite to beat Fonfara (29-4, 17 KOs) again (meaning you’d have to wager $1,100 in order to win $100), and Stevenson already seems to be looking forward to possibly fighting the winner of the Andre Ward-Sergey Kovalev II winner....&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>Deontay Wilder vs Tyson Fury: Who is on the undercard?
