With congressional races tightening around the country, that premise will be tested on Tuesday, when Golden State voters cast the final ballots in seven congressional districts held by Republicans that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, which are key to Democrats' path to retaking the House. Some are closer than others. But all of them ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item><item><title>Trump Tries To Revive Doubt Over Kavanaugh Claims After Little-Known Accuser Recants - HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-kavanaugh-judy-munro-leighton-twitter_us_5bdda3b9e4b04367a87cf5e0</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJ5pbpThSVszzlSg-d6YZCgqFggEKg0IACoGCAowxYgCMIBNMJeP1AM</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 15:50:11 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-kavanaugh-judy-munro-leighton-twitter_us_5bdda3b9e4b04367a87cf5e0" target="_blank"&gt;Trump Tries To Revive Doubt Over Kavanaugh Claims After Little-Known Accuser Recants&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump on Saturday attempted to cast renewed doubt on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh by pointing to the recantation of one little-known accuser. The woman, Judy Munro-Leighton, falsely claimed to have authored a “Jane Doe” letter stating that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her “several times” in the back seat of a car, which the judge denies. The true author of the letter remains unknown, and the claim was not widely reported on during the September confirmation hearings. “A vicious accuser of Justice Kavanaugh has just admitted tha...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>Rallies, Taxes and Bus Tours: Down to the Wire in Orange County - The New York Times</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/politics/california-congress-orange-county.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEArwahrW7Wc_TIgeiJJweEwqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowjuuKAzCWrzwwt4QY</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2018 19:06:47 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/politics/california-congress-orange-county.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rallies, Taxes and Bus Tours: Down to the Wire in Orange County&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correction: November 4, 2018 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the Democratic candidate in the 39th Congressional District.

Over the course of several years, Brayton has posted racist and violent memes of Democrat politicians, including one of President Barack Obama with a noose around his neck.
