Your LinkedIn page may be a work of art wrought in HR-friendly prose; your tweets, so sharp you could shave with them. But texting? Let the autocorrect errors fly! Why punctuate? Isn’t that what old people do? In fact, why use words at all when any number of pictographic pokes, nods, and grunts available at the press of a button will get the job done faster?

While aimed at developers, I/O is where Google announces stuff that any designer or consumer cares about–like the future of Android and Search. Last year, I/O was a product blitz: It brought us the Google Assistant, the Google Home speaker, Google’s first phone, the Pixel, and a AI-driven messenger called Allo. That’s all on top of its big push into VR for the everyman, known as Daydream. It was Google’s most important year ever in hardware, and it made the search and advertising company look prime...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.fastcodesign.com">Fast Company</source></item><item><title>The Rise Of Auto-Complete Culture–And Why We Should Resist - Fast Company</title><link>https://www.fastcodesign.com/90126569/the-rise-of-autocomplete-culture</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMs-mNwqvhbr7FZKkuCZmxgqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowlacCMKBPMIGcAg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 07:00:20 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90126569/the-rise-of-autocomplete-culture" target="_blank"&gt;The Rise Of Auto-Complete Culture–And Why We Should Resist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend and fellow writer I hadn’t heard from for a while sent me an email the other day.

And at the bottom of her thoughtful email, Google offered me three quick responses in the iOS Gmail app: Thanks! You’re welcome! Sounds good to me! With a tap, I could auto-fill my response to her.

Can cute digital stickers change that? Emoji may have gone high-brow now that they're part of MoMA's permanent collection, but back on the front lines—on people's devices and in text conversations—a new form of pictorial communication has taken hold. They're called digital stickers, and when it comes to compensating for the lack of facial and visual cues in digital communication, they've got emoji beat. While the Snapchat-backed Bitmoji popularized stickers in the West (they've been in Asian markets for a f...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.fastcodesign.com">Fast Company</source></item><item><title>Google’s message app Allo overshares data with friends - RT</title><link>https://www.rt.com/usa/380746-googles-message-app-allo-overshares/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEO1GHdRXI2WYoWeIdu71SgwqFwgEKg8IACoHCAownP3cAjDQkhww7oMo</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 21:41:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/380746-googles-message-app-allo-overshares/" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s message app Allo overshares data with friends&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;RT&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy advocates are raising alarm about Google’s messenger app Allo, pointing out that its Google Assistant overshares search data when not prompted, and the app itself lacks encryption and is potentially open to government spying. “In the middle of our conversation, my friend directed Assistant to identify itself,” wrote Tess Townsend in her review of Allo in Re/code on Tuesday. “Instead of offering a name or a pithy retort, it responded with a link from Harry Potter fan website Pottermore.” Google’s Allo app can reveal what you’ve searched to your friendshttps://t.co/tmzCVODEVo pic.twit...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rt.com">RT</source></item><item><title>Google Assistant is Getting Ready to Compete with Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana - Forbes Now</title><link>http://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2016/11/12/google-assistant-is-getting-ready-to-compete-with-amazon-alexa-and-microsoft-cortana/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEII0m6OWZao44FnncdvgmFQqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 19:31:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2016/11/12/google-assistant-is-getting-ready-to-compete-with-amazon-alexa-and-microsoft-cortana/" target="_blank"&gt;Google Assistant is Getting Ready to Compete with Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for personal assistants with conversational user experience is heating up.

When Google Assistant arrived a couple of years ago, chatbots were all the rage in products like Facebook Messenger and Microsoft’s Skype. Simulating a back-and-forth conversation was supposed to be more efficient than poking around in traditional apps, and chatbot proponents hyped this model as the future of software design.

Since then, however, the company has been steadily refining its design strategy to get out of the way and put users first.

Not every business needs to have an account on every platform. And it doesn’t make sense to have a social media account without a goal or purpose. That’s why, at BusySeed, we sit down with every client individually to weigh the pros and cons of each platform directly related to their social media marketing goals.

Google spent 18 months carefully redesigning the emoji, unveiling the revamped version here on Co.Design just over a year ago. Despite the protests of Android users who loved the old emoji, the blobs were history. Or so we thought. Google is now bringing back the beloved if amorphous emoji as a sticker pack.
