According to a new theory, everything we have observed so far actually floats in a mysterious, theoretical, ‘cosmic soup’. The remaining 95 percent of the universe, we currently believe, is made up of dark matter or dark energy; theoretical entities that we're only aware of because we have observed how their gravity affects things around them. In a recently published paper, Oxford astrophysicist Jamie Farnes has proposed that dark energy and dark matter actually combine to form a “dark flui...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rt.com">RT</source></item><item><title>Einstein's 'God Letter' fetches $3.9 million at New York auction - ABC News</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-05/einstein-god-letter-fetches-3.9-million-at-new-york-auction/10584228</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGMED8fqLZ0AYVsISRX5yykqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDciw4</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:59:06 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-05/einstein-god-letter-fetches-3.9-million-at-new-york-auction/10584228" target="_blank"&gt;Einstein's 'God Letter' fetches $3.9 million at New York auction&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handwritten letter in which Nobel physicist Albert Einstein took issue with the concept of religion and his own Jewish faith has sold for nearly $US2.9 million ($3.9 million) at auction in New York.
