Here are five of them. Well, I hate to tell you “I told you so.” But I told you so. When I wrote an article about Fallout 76 and how dubious I was that it would be a good game ready for a release in 2018, I received tons of backlash from angry fans. Now the game is rocking a 49/100 Metacritic score (on Xbox One, it’s slightly higher on PC and PS4) with a 2.7 user score. That’s just about the worst-reviewed AAA game of the year, and one of the worst-reviewed AAA games in recent memory, and certainly of this console generation. Ouch.

In many ways, at least for those of us who comment on the video game industry’s many foibles, Fallout 76 is the gift that keeps on giving. Not so much, however, if you spent $200 on the game’s Power Armor Edition, thought you’d get a nice canvas bag, and were sent a cheap nylon bag instead. This on top of the game being a hot pile of steaming garbage, riddled with performance issues, bland combat and recycled assets.

A huge game based on a huge IP that took years to craft, and yet its arrival has been marked by some of the lowest critic and user scores in modern gaming history. While Bethesda has often been given free passes for buggy titles, Fallout 76 has taken things to a new level on that front, and its technical issues are compounded by the core design problems of a multiplayer, survivalist Fallout experience few people asked for, or if they did, this is definitely not what they had in mind.

Needless to say, the press hasn’t been too pleased, and I think most fans agree with them. Even if many gaming fans have been at odds with the press over different issues in the last few years, “no information about the functionality or quality of a game ahead of launch” isn’t exactly something anyone but a ga...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>Bethesda's Decision To Withhold Review Copies Is Bad For Gamers And Sets A Dangerous Precedent - Forbes Now</title><link>http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/10/25/bethesdas-decision-to-withhold-review-copies-is-bad-for-gamers-and-sets-a-dangerous-precedent/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOOaIKcp22Z61WPATwdXNWUqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 02:12:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/10/25/bethesdas-decision-to-withhold-review-copies-is-bad-for-gamers-and-sets-a-dangerous-precedent/" target="_blank"&gt;Bethesda's Decision To Withhold Review Copies Is Bad For Gamers And Sets A Dangerous Precedent&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skyrim: Special Edition comes out Friday; reviewers get code on Thursday. (Credit: Bethesda) Bethesda has changed their policy regarding review copies in a way that’s bad for consumers, critics, the relationship between Bethesda and its friends in the media, and the video game industry as a whole. It sets a bad precedent for video game publishers and ultimately will lead to less information in the hands of consumers. Today in a blog post, Bethesda wrote that “we value media reviews.” They then went on to prove how no, they do not in fact value reviews and would prefer to do away with them e...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>'Dishonored 2' Totally Fumbles Its Split-Hero Core Concept - Forbes Now</title><link>http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/11/11/dishonored-2-totally-fumbles-its-split-hero-core-concept/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEDoPM-TmgODmg0WIJrHq-OEqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2016 15:42:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/11/11/dishonored-2-totally-fumbles-its-split-hero-core-concept/" target="_blank"&gt;'Dishonored 2' Totally Fumbles Its Split-Hero Core Concept&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo: Bethesda Dishonored 2 comes out today, and thanks to Bethesda’s new review copy policy, you probably won’t see many full reviews out for at least a little while. But copies did go out about a day and a half before launch, and as such, I’ve worked my way through most of the game after a couple marathon sessions. And there’s one aspect I feel like I need to comment on above all others. Dishonored 2 was sold on a pretty central concept, a sequel to the acclaimed original that lets you play either as Corvo, the hero of the first game, or (spoilers) Emily, his daughter and current empress...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>3 Reasons 'Elder Scrolls Online' Now Has 8.5 Million Players - Forbes Now</title><link>http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/02/27/3-reason-elder-scrolls-online-now-has-8-5-million-players/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEqGZ5LfWJilEHBNCcbtQhkqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/02/27/3-reason-elder-scrolls-online-now-has-8-5-million-players/" target="_blank"&gt;3 Reasons 'Elder Scrolls Online' Now Has 8.5 Million Players&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would be hard-pressed to find an MMO that has so rapidly evolved as Elder Scrolls Online. What was once a game that was met with mixed reviews has course corrected into becoming one of the best games out there. In a recent interview with MMORG.com, game director Matt Firor said that ESO has 8.5 million players based on copies of the game that have been sold. There are lot of good reasons for why ESO is growing in players in such an otherwise tough genre.

Is it when more bugs are patched? When the servers stabilize? When the player population becomes more engaged? When the content is bolstered by enough new stuff to pump life into the world? Perhaps, so maybe a week and 35-40 hours with Fallout 76 isn’t giving it enough of a fair shake, and yet I think the line has to be drawn somewhere when it comes to the state of new games at launch.

Credit: Bethesda Dishonored was one of my favorite games of 2012, combining terrific first-person combat with magic powers and a strong, but optional, stealth component. You could play the game however you liked, sewing chaos and death, or sneaking your way through each mission. As an assassin out for justice and revenge, you could kill your objectives or take them out non-lethally (though not necessarily non-violently.)

We’ve gotten a few poor attempts at Thrones titles over the years, most recently Telltale’s narrative-driven game that had to awkwardly work within existing show plot points, but never a full-on, massive RPG.
