The study, published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature, found that Greenland's ice loss accelerated rapidly in the past two decades after remaining relatively stable since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1800s. Today, Greenland's ice sheets are melting at a rate 50% higher than pre-industrial levels and 33% above 20th-century levels, the scientists found.

In an interview with Piers Morgan that aired on Sunday, Jan. 28, 2018, on Britain’s ITV News, the president said the world was cooling and warming at the same time and that claims of melting ice caps haven’t come true.

The problem is that the warmer weather is allowing more dark algae to grow on the ice. Because ice is white, it reflects much of the sun’s energy, but dark algae absorb the heat, increasing the rate of melting. The Greenland ice sheet is up to 3km thick and would raise sea levels by seven metres if it all melted into the sea.

One of the leading causes of sea level rise is the melting of ice from glaciers and ice sheets. The Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea levels by more than 22 feet. As the world gets hotter, the ice will keep melting, and it has the potential to wipe out coastal cities all around the world–and submerge entire island countries under the water.

Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica were known to be shrinking but the East Antarctic was thought to be far more stable. However, in a new paper published in the journal Nature, a research team found the East Antarctic ice sheet has actually been sensitive to climate change for millions of years. This instability could mean the ice sheet is more susceptible to current global warming than previously tho...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Fragile Arctic is here to stay: Report - Al Jazeera English</title><link>http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/fragile-arctic-stay-report-171213085536861.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEELgKP02aBr1pfi94QQtAOMqFAgEKgwIACoFCAowhgIwkDgw0O8B</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 11:06:19 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/fragile-arctic-stay-report-171213085536861.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fragile Arctic is here to stay: Report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Al Jazeera English&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arctic sea ice is becoming increasingly thin and transient, and this is having huge impacts on the flora and fauna of the region according to a report from NOAA. The generally gloomy findings from the Arctic Report Card for September show that despite much cooler than average spring and summer weather across the region, summer sea ice continues to dwindle and ice melt from the Greenland ice sheet is continuing, albeit at a slower rate. Year-on-year warming continues across the region, with average air temperatures, for the year ending September 2017, being the second highest on record since...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.aljazeera.com">Al Jazeera English</source></item><item><title>New NASA tool can tell you which glacier may flood your city as the planet warms - CNN</title><link>http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/world/nasa-sea-level-rise-forecast/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEpxcM65DZyT5mhLDfCh69UqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMPvTpgU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2017 21:27:18 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/world/nasa-sea-level-rise-forecast/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;New NASA tool can tell you which glacier may flood your city as the planet warms&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea level rise is one of the most recognizable consequences of climate change and is likely to be one of the most destructive as well. Projecting when destructive coastal inundation could occur in your city just became easier, thanks to a new tool developed by NASA scientists. By pinpointing which specific glaciers and ice sheets are contributing to local sea level rise for individual coastal cities, scientists can paint a more complete and accurate picture of what global warming will mean for rising ocean levels. "This study allows one person to understand which icy areas of the world will...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item></channel></rss>
