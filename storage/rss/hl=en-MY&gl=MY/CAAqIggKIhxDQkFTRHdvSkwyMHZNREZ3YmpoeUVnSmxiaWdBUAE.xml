Mahathir’s message is there must be a united Malay under one master, not Malays split into Umno, PKR, PAS, PPBM, and Amanah.

I must confess that lately, Malaysia appears to be failing. Not a day passes by without more events that clearly highlight Malaysia ‘s race-religion fault-line. If things keep going this way, I fear for Malaysia ‘s future. Today, schools in Singapore celebrate Racial Harmony Day. I can visibly see the joy in the children’s faces as they wear their ethnic costumes and have fun together at school.
