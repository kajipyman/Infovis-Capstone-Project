Former President George H.W. Bush was remembered at his funeral on Wednesday as a “kinder and gentler” leader who steered the country through storms at home and abroad. As bells tolled, choirs sang and flags flew at half-staff on Wednesday, the nation solemnly said goodbye to the 41st president....&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Whose Attorney General Will William Barr Be? - The New York Times</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/william-barr-attorney-general-trump.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiECPMVqs1MY265-_kjauUsHEqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowjuuKAzCWrzwwt4QY</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 01:43:39 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/william-barr-attorney-general-trump.html" target="_blank"&gt;Whose Attorney General Will William Barr Be?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that can be said about William Barr, whom President Trump has chosen to serve as his next attorney general, is that he knows the ways of the Department of Justice. Unlike Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Jeff Sessions’s former chief of staff and a troubling interim replacement in more ways than one, Mr. Barr is intimately familiar with the nation’s chief law enforcement agency, having served as President George H.W.

Mr. Barr, 68, would become the nation’s top law enforcement official as Mr. Trump and his associates are under investigation by the special counsel, Robert S.
