On November 28, the student became violent, requiring staff at Guiding Hands School to restrain him to “prevent the injury of staff and students,” the El Dorado County sheriff said. The student then became unresponsive. A teacher tried performing CPR, and the boy was rushed to the hospital but did not survive.

ALAIN JOCARD/AFP/Getty Images A new laptop at home might boost a child’s digital savvy, but boosting their skills as a student could be another matter, a new study indicates. After researchers gave free laptops with web access to kids in Lima, Peru, starting in 2011, the researchers determined the children ended up with higher computer and internet proficiency, compared to peers without the devices.

Parents said first grade children at Cedar Hill Elementary School in Montville, had to be consoled after the incident, which was sparked when one pupil asserted Santa Claus was real. The child’s statement is thought to have prompted an outburst from the teacher in question, who then reportedly went on to debunk several other myths including the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny.

After graduating from law school three years earlier, he was stuck making monthly payments on $100,000 worth of loans, and wasn’t even beginning to chip away at the principal. But Lakier qualified for a federal student loan forgiveness program. “The plan was, I would wait 20 years and if I made those minimum payments, the rest would be forgiven,” he remembers. His employer at the time, Ernst &amp; Young, had recently begun offering a discount on student loan refinancing as part of its employee benefits package.

The school system said in a statement that Vlaming was fired for insubordination. Over the summer, the ninth-grade student's family informed the school system of the student's gender transition to male. The student wasn't involved in Thursday's hearing.
