Stay safely tied to the tree either by a top rope you\u2019ve looped over sturdy branches above or with two ropes secured around the trunk. To avoid spooking the cat, climb quietly, without breaking dead branches or yelling progress reports to onlookers below. Watch for signs you might be dealing with a jumper: Is the cat crawling..."
