The worldwide unemployment rate has dropped from 8 per cent of the workforce in 2010 to 5.2 per cent in September, the lowest level since 5 per cent in 1980, according to an analysis by UBS, the investment bank. The survey encompassed 48 developed and emerging economies, which between them account for 84 per cent of global output.

While the first G20 in 2008 was confronted by threats to the global economy after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Argentina’s deep currency crisis this year has, say local experts, cast a shadow over the Buenos Aires forum. Recent months have brought a devaluation of the Argentine peso against the dollar of more than 50 per cent, 60 per cent interest rates and a $56bn IMF emergency bailout.

That was a sharper deceleration than the OPEC nation's 16.6 percent contraction in 2017, according to preliminary data compiled by the country's central bank.

Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has begun to warn global leaders not to assume that the rapid growth of 2017 will return soon. Across the world, “risks are beginning to materialise”, she says. ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item><item><title>Land confiscation plans will hurt South Africa's economic growth, IMF warns - RT</title><link>https://www.rt.com/business/444429-imf-south-africa-economy/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPmyiucbKsiGGPGeEoYkZfEqFwgEKg8IACoHCAownP3cAjDQkhwwroQo</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 10:40:03 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/business/444429-imf-south-africa-economy/" target="_blank"&gt;Land confiscation plans will hurt South Africa's economic growth, IMF warns&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;RT&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s economic recovery faces serious constraints, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which pointed to land reform, growing debt of state firms, and capital outflows as obstacles for growth. “Some of the initial optimism has dissipated as growth remains stuck in low gear and reform implementation has faced constraints,” the IMF said, naming the state power firm Eskom as a key risk.
