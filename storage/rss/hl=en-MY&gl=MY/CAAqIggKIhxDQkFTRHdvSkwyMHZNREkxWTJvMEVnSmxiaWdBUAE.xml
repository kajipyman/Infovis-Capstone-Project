Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat who served as George W.

Trump, in a letter to new Prime Minister Imran Khan, asked for Pakistan's "support and facilitation" in negotiating an end to the war and offered to renew the strained relationship, Pakistan's foreign ministry said.

The crossing — known as the Kartarpur corridor — is a rare sign of cooperation between the rival nuclear-armed countries.

Predictably, this landed him in hot water. To make matters worse, Khan made the remarks at a conference celebrating the birthday of none other than the Prophet Mohammed. Praising the greatness of the Muslim prophet, the politician suddenly delved deeper into religious history than anyone was expecting. “Moses does find some mention but we don’t find mention of Hasrat Isa [Jesus Christ] in human history,” Khan said.
