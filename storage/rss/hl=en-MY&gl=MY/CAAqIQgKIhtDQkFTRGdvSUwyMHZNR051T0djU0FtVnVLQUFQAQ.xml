The 32-year-old mum was born without a womb due to the rare Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, which doesn’t allow the vagina and uterus to form properly. Desperate for a child but with little hope of having one, the woman got a womb transplant from a 45-year-old mum-of-three who had died of a stroke.

For the analysis, researchers examined data on 727 infants born at two major hospitals in Singapore. Overall, 222 deliveries were surgical, and 74 of these procedures were elective - not done because of medical issues with the mother or baby. The rest were emergency surgeries.

The cut stretches from her lower abdomen through her belly button and up past her stomach. The 18-year-old gave birth by caesarean section in April 2018, but the baby died of asphyxia after becoming stuck and suffering brain damage from lack of oxygen. While she was grieving, the wound became infected. She was given IV antibiotics but it started to release foul-smelling pus. The infection spread to her uterus.

As soon as she heard the good news, the doctor hit her with some bad news: He said her weight ― 211 pounds at 5 feet, 1 inch ― would be a problem. She was less than six weeks’ pregnant, but her doctor started talking about labor. He announced she was “too obese” to give birth vaginally and would have to have a cesarean section. He didn’t elaborate and Hilary, caught off-guard, didn’t ask questions. “I was stunned,” she said.

The long-held belief has been that women who were induced early were more likely to need a caesarean section. But new research published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine says that isn't the case. "For many years there has been a belief, really deeply ingrained, that labour induction leads to a greater chance of caesarean delivery," said the study's lead author Bill Grobman, an obstetrician-gynaeco...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item><item><title>Scandal-hit NHS Trust faces calls for wider investigation into deaths on maternity unit - The Telegraph</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/31/scandal-hit-nhs-trust-faces-calls-wider-investigation-deaths/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHU-yz4aIICQJ2VTHUX7zhYqFggEKg4IACoGCAowm6R6MMKqCTCfrxU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2018 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/31/scandal-hit-nhs-trust-faces-calls-wider-investigation-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;Scandal-hit NHS Trust faces calls for wider investigation into deaths on maternity unit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of families have come forward with concerns their babies may have been killed or seriously injured at a “toxic” NHS maternity unit accused of being obsessed with natural births.

Yet research shows that things like loving relationships, safe homes and being part of a fair and equitable community also play an important role in whether a woman has a positive experience with pregnancy and giving birth.
