In this article, I wish to suggest that the Pakatan Harapan (PH) leaders have a false understanding of real political power in Malaysia in the present time. Real political power in post-Reformasi Malaysia no longer lies in the Cabinet offices of the many ministries. Real power is actually what the Reformasi movement sparked off. The victors of the May 9 general election need to understand that what they inherited after GE14 was a rickety and ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.malaysia-today.net">Malaysia Today</source></item><item><title>Myanmar court jails anti-war protesters for defaming military - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-activists/myanmar-court-jails-anti-war-protesters-for-defaming-military-idUSKBN1O61A4</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJmwT9HrcLfXQ-mKzC762XYqFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMLT5lwM</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 19:35:30 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-activists/myanmar-court-jails-anti-war-protesters-for-defaming-military-idUSKBN1O61A4" target="_blank"&gt;Myanmar court jails anti-war protesters for defaming military&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Myanmar court jailed three activists on Friday for defaming the military during anti-war protests, amid growing concern about a clamp-down on civil society.

One of the participants to the meeting, Christophe Chalancon, told reporters the delegation of protesters called for measures aimed at improving the workers' salaries and the purchasing power of the French.
