He said the Pakatan Harapan government had previously promised that those who earned less than RM4,000 per month could delay repaying their loans. "It appears that the promise to postpone repayment of loans for those earning less than RM4,000 did not materialise. The minimum wage is now RM1,100.

Now that it is in government, getting what it wants should be a done deal, right? Unfortunately, it missed several opportunities to implement the proposals in its own alternative budget of 2018.

"How sad that a former prime minister has become a troll, and even sadder (that) he is quite proud of it," Lim said in a statement Thursday (Oct 25).
