On his Facebook page, Najib said that his interview with a local Malay daily should be viewed in full as it was "easy to get the wrong perception when we only read the headline". In the interview with Sinar Harian on Thursday (Nov 22), he was asked by the host if it can now be admitted that Malaysia was cheated by Low, better known as Jho Low, in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal.

In a statement issued by Messrs Shafee &amp; Co, Najib’s lead defence lawyer Tan Sri Shafee Abdullah (pic) questioned why Madinah, by her own admission, released her statement on Sunday (Nov 25) morning after being told to do so following a briefing to the Cabinet on Friday (Nov 23). “The Auditor-General’s press statement read by any ordinary pers...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.thestar.com.my">The Star Online</source></item><item><title>Mahathir’s honeymoon fades as old ways resurface - Financial Times</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/8d95866c-f316-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOBox9Ia9SaPgwyzpMEQ4dAqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow-4fWBzD4z0gwwtp6</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:00:25 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8d95866c-f316-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d" target="_blank"&gt;Mahathir’s honeymoon fades as old ways resurface&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahathir Mohamad remains popular with Malaysians after his stunning election upset in May. However, the euphoria that greeted his victory has quickly faded as cracks appear in the ruling coalition and as some of the prime minister’s actions bring uncomfortable echoes of the past. Mr Mahathir, who sensationally returned to the prime-ministership to head a four-party coalition, is making good on his vow to clean up corruption. Our third-quarter survey of 1,000 urban Malaysians showed that they like what his government is doing so far.
