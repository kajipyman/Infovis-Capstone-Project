As the country's warring parties hold U.N.-mediated talks in Stockholm, the World Food Program (WFP) in Rome is calling for immediate access because millions of people need food. More than 20 million people in a country with a population of over 29 million are expected to need humanitarian assistance next year. The WFP says a food security survey in October carried out by Yemeni and international experts found that more than 15 million people were in "crisis."

The announcement came as Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, met for a second day for U.N.-sponsored talks aimed at halting the bloodshed.
