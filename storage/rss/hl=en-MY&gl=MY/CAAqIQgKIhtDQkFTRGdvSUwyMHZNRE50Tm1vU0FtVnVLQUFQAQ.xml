General Assembly is scheduled to vote on a historic U.S.-sponsored resolution Thursday condemning Hamas rocket attacks into Israel. This would be the first time the assembly casts a vote critical of Hamas — the militant group that rules Gaza. The Palestinians sought to amend the resolution by inserting language referring to previous resolutions criticizing Israeli settlements. But in order to win backing from all 28 European Union members, the U.S. agreed to mention "relevant U.N. resolutions" without saying which ones.

Thousands of Palestinians demonstrated Friday despite wintry weather, throwing rocks with slingshots at Israeli troops deployed behind the fence. The soldiers repeatedly fired volleys of tear gas and live fire, witnesses say. Hamas, the Islamic militant group controlling Gaza, has maintained such protests on a weekly basis since March, accelerating or scaling them down to pressure Israel and mediators into easing Gaza's crippling blockade.

Some 300 fans attended Sunday's performance, staring in awed silence as Japanese and local artists performed for them. For many, it was the first time they had ever heard a piano performed live.

But in Sderot, a border town worst hit by the 460 rockets militants fired into south Israel, residents did that just. Hundreds gathered, burning tyres, blocking roads and chanting “disgrace” when the rocket sirens finally went silent. “While everyone feels the end of something and people have a sense of relief, we don’t get this.

Thousands of Palestinians participated Friday in a Hamas-organized rally along the perimeter fence dividing Gaza from Israel, with crowds staying at least 300 meters from the fence. However, Gaza's health ministry said 40 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli fire and tear gas, without giving a number breakdown. Witnesses said most of the injuries occurred in stone-throwing incidents at the us...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.apnews.com">The Associated Press</source></item><item><title>Netanyahu's government survives as Israel coalition partners back down on ultimatum - The Telegraph</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/19/netanyahus-government-survives-israel-coalition-partners-back/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGinO0_NvGaBL7pYDFC4qnwqFggEKg4IACoGCAowm6R6MMKqCTCfrxU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/19/netanyahus-government-survives-israel-coalition-partners-back/" target="_blank"&gt;Netanyahu's government survives as Israel coalition partners back down on ultimatum&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government appears to have survived a major political crisis after one of his coalition partners backed down from threats to bring down the government and trigger early elections. The Israeli government looked to be on the brink of collapse Monday morning after Mr Netanyahu refused demands from the Jewish Home party to give them control of the defence ministry. Naftali Bennett, the leader of Jewish Home, called a press conference where he was widely expected to announce he was resigning from the cabinet and bringing down the government.

Wars that don’t end decisively — in absolute victory for one side and unequivocal defeat for the other — tend not to end at all. This idea — that the European “peace” that held from 1918 to 1939 was really just a pause in a single long war that ended only with Germany’s surrender in 1945 — is hardly original to me. But it’s worth considering as America wages forever w...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Lieberman’s Colorful Career Reaches a Fork.
