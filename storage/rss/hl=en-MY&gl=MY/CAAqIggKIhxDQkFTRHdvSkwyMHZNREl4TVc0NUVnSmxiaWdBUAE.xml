Although most of us are angels, but even angels sometimes make mistakes. So when angels makes mistakes, they turn around.” (MMO) – Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad today made a cheeky comeback to critics who labelled his administration as a “U-turn government”. In a press conference here using veiled replies, the Langkawi MP said that turnarounds under his governance were only done if necessary, adding that the Pakatan Harapan (PH) Cabinet was not perfect though it has been trying to correct many things. “Sometimes when we go the wrong way, we turn around, ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.malaysia-today.net">Malaysia Today</source></item><item><title>We’ll walk together but we’ll never be one, says Hadi - The Star Online</title><link>https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/12/07/well-walk-together-but-well-never-be-one-says-hadi/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEA_QH9H3bqaTmx0VnXIBzGEqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMNKriAM</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/12/07/well-walk-together-but-well-never-be-one-says-hadi/" target="_blank"&gt;We’ll walk together but we’ll never be one, says Hadi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Star Online&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETALING JAYA: PAS and Umno may walk hand in hand to oppose Icerd tomorrow bu they will never be one, says PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang (pic).
