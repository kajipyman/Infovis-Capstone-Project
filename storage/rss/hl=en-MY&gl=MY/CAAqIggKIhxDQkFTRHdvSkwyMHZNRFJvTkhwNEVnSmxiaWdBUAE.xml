Tan Cheng Hoe’s side drew 0-0 in the first-leg at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil on Saturday (Dec 1) but battled well against Thailand, who are fancied to win the coveted trophy. While Thailand has promised a “nightmarish” experience for Malaysia, Harimau Malaya is unperturbed by the threats and is only looking at maintaining their good momentum for the match.

The Harimau Malaya held the War Elephants to a goalless draw in the first leg at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil last Saturday.

The Selangor right-back, who received the ball from Syamer Kutty Abba from the middle, drove forward and took a thunderous shot which went past the hapless Chathchai Budprom in the 27th minute.

Malaysia and Thailand played out a goalless draw in the first leg at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil last Saturday, which saw Tan Cheng Hoe’s men dominating the match with attacking tactics.

Midfielder Syamer Kutty Abba said if the players continue their upwards momentum in Bangkok for the second leg of the semi-final against Thailand at the Rajamangala Stadium tomorrow (8pm Malaysian time), there is a chance for an upset.

The Harimau Malaya have not lost to Thailand at home in 47 years and the Thais’ only win on the Malaysian soil was at the 1971 Merdeka Tournament where they won 2-0.

Thailand were put under pressure in the first leg of the AFF Suzuki Cup semi-final against Malaysia on Saturday as the hosts were relentless in their pursuit for goals.

Strikers N. Thanabalan struck in the 33rd minute before Safawi Rasid added the second in the 35th minute to give coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee’s men a comfortable 2-0 lead. Thanabalan added the third in the 82nd minute to kill off Myanmar, who tried to make a match of it with an 86th-minute goal by Than Paing. But it clearly proved to be too little, too late.

The Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) winger, who has yet to break his duck in the tournament, said that he is not overly concerned over his lack of goals but wants to help the team do well against Myanmar tomorrow in Bukit Jalil. “Maybe luck is not on my side (on scoring the goals). For the next game, I will try my best to score,” said Safawi. “If it does not happen, it’s okay, I’m not concerned about who is going to score against Myanmar.

The 45-year-old former national striker knows all about the game here and is confident that Thailand can return home with the gold medal. As a player, Woorawoot scored seven goals in the 9-0 rout of Malaysia’s 2000 Olympic team in a friendly in Bangkok in 1998. “Yes, I know Malaysian football.

The Southern Tigers have won a total of seven M-League titles – Super League (three), Charity Shield (two) and FA Cup (one)– since their formation in 2013. And they also won the second-tier AFC Cup in 2015. But they have never won the Malaysia Cup, the country’s most prestigious football tournament. With the Super League title virtually in the bag for the fourth year running, JDT head coach Ulisses Morais wants his men to end the anomaly.

Last night, winger Mohd Syazwan Zainon and goalkeeper Hafizul Hakim Khairul Nizam Jothy saved the blushes for the nine-man Harimau Malaya in a hard fought battle.

Jafri made the first XI in the opening 2-1 win over Brunei but failed to score and was dropped for the next match against Singapore which Malaysia won 2-1. On Monday, the Penang striker came off the bench and provided an assist for N. Thanabalan’s second goal in the 3-1 win over Myanmar.

The Pahang skipper, who helped the Under-23 team win the silver medal at the Kuala Lumpur SEA Games last month, has received his second call-up under Portuguese coach Eduardo Vingada.
