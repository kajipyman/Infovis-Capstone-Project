South Sudan, the world's youngest country, has been embroiled in civil conflict since 2013, with its civilian population paying a heavy price. South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with rebel leaders in September but it is not yet clear if the agreement will hold. The unrest has driven nearly 4 million people from their homes, according to UN figures, with hunger and violence widespread.

But armaments are vectors of violence: translating intent and anger into lethal force. Easy access to weapons empowers violent political groups, criminals and terrorists, hastens the descent of vulnerable societies into conflict and greatly magnifies the toll and duration of war. From Syria and Libya to South Sudan and Somalia, the illicit supply of weapons has fuelled conflict, reversed socio-economic development gains to pre-1960s levels, and undermined successive efforts to broker peace.
