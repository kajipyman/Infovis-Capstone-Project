In the first few days of the game’s release in Japan, it managed to sell 661,240 copies. However, the really remarkable news is how Switch sales have reacted to this game. Put simply, since the game was released last week the Switch has shifted 200,850 units.

Not only is it almost half the price to play many of the same (or very similar) games, but it offers multiplayer experiences like Nintendo Land that are still unmatched by the Switch. The Wii U underperformed by most measures, and is now perceived as something of a failed — or at least ill-timed — video game system.

This might not be immediately apparent by looking at the ad, however, because there’s a ton of information there and the eye is naturally drawn to price tags, for obvious reasons. But you shouldn’t miss this one little line that puts it up above some other retailers: “Free $50 g...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>'Pokémon: Let's Go' Review: It's Time To Go Back To A Rather Different Kanto - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/11/18/pokemon-lets-go-review-its-time-to-go-back-to-a-rather-different-kanto/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMSaJ8U-V-ehXxFZdOTKwf4qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 13:20:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/11/18/pokemon-lets-go-review-its-time-to-go-back-to-a-rather-different-kanto/" target="_blank"&gt;'Pokémon: Let's Go' Review: It's Time To Go Back To A Rather Different Kanto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Pokémon: Let’s Go’ retains a lot from the classic mainline games in the series. Back when the Switch was launched last year, it was somewhat obvious that certain studios were taken aback by its massive popularity. So much so that developers like Game Freak realized they had to get in on the action and fast, and lo Pokémon: Let’s Go was born. For those that played Pokémon back during the Game Boy days, then the approach in Let’s Go will be very familiar. That’s because Pokémon: Let’s Go is based on Pokémon Yellow but by way of the newer mobile phenomenon Pokémon GO.

By and large, Black Friday is a good time to buy video game hardware. It’s not subject to some of the same bait and switch that you see in a lot of other industries, mostly because there isn’t a lot of room to do so with so few products and fairly well-known price points. If you see a good price you can buy it with some confidence: there’s a chance you might see someone match the price in the coming months, but it’s very unlikely that anyone is going to go lower. So go nuts when it comes to the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X, the PS4 or the Nintendo Switch.

Emerging from your vault, two decades after nuclear war has devastated the Earth, your task to reclaim the ashes of what’s left is an inglorious one. There is no one to celebrate your toil, no one to commemorate you as a hero. Bethesda’s prequel to its Fallout series has taken the increasingly popular route of the online multiplayer – the irony is just how isolating an experience that can be.

If you’re looking to buy a new console, you could do a whole lot worse than late November. In most cases, you could actually do a whole lot worse than early November or December, but Black Friday remains the best time to pick up the best deals. That means those magical hours when the Thanksgiving meal wears off and everyone storms into the world of retail to buy whatever it is they’ve been putting off buying. Historically speaking, that day has some of if not the best deals on most consoles for the year.
