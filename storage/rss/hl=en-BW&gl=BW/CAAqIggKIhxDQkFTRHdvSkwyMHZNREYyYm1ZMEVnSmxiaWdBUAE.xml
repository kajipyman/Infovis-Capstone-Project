The remarks of Gwede Mantashe, who is a close ally of President Cyril Ramaphosa, were partly blamed for the weakening of the South African rand on Wednesday. "You shouldn't own more than 12,000 hectares of land and therefore if you own more, it should be taken without compensation," Mantashe, who is also the country's mines minister, told the News24 website in an interview published on Wednesday.

The government is reportedly planning to put an end to what they call the legacy of apartheid, where nearly 95 percent of the South African wealth was kept in the hands of 10 percent of its white population.
