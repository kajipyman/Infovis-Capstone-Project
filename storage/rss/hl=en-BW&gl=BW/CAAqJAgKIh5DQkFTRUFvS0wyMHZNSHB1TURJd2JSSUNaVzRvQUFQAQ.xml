A huge game based on a huge IP that took years to craft, and yet its arrival has been marked by some of the lowest critic and user scores in modern gaming history. While Bethesda has often been given free passes for buggy titles, Fallout 76 has taken things to a new level on that front, and its technical issues are compounded by the core design problems of a multiplayer, survivalist Fallout experience few people asked for, or if they did, this is definitely not what they had in mind.

Fallout 76 may be the highest profile release with the lowest review scores I can remember seeing in at least a decade, or really since metascores became a thing. It’s Bethesda’s lowest rated game by a huge margin, it’s scoring worse than No Man’s Sky, Mass Effect Andromeda, vanilla Destiny and all those other big titles that were high profile critical disappointments at launch.

One Hello Games employee thinks so. (Credit: Hello Games) Developer Hello Games has been strangely silent since the summer release of their game, No Man’s Sky. It’s been one of those silences that somehow grows louder and louder the longer it remains. Then, this morning, all that changed. “No Man’s Sky was a mistake,” the developer’s Twitter feed proclaimed, shockingly, for all the world to see.

Developers Hello Games have announced a vast number of changes that hope to fix the problems that have dogged the game since it was first released two years ago. Before its launch, No Man's Sky was one of the most lauded games of the decade. Critics were thrilled by the way the game offered an entire universe that would be generated by computers, all of which would be waiting for players to discover.

Here's Everything You Need To Know&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Man’s Sky’s biggest expansion so far, Next, is coming soon. No Man’s Sky launched in August of 2016 to scathing reviews and mystified customers. The much ballyhooed game felt to many like an unfinished product—something you’d expect to be in Early Access rather than a full-priced release. Now, nearly two years later, Hello Games is aiming to win back the faith of the gaming community with its largest free update to the game so far: No Man’s Sky Next. So what is ‘Next’ anyways? Below, find everything you need to know about the expansion—from release date to major changes to the brand new ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>Here Are All The Video Games Releasing In July (2018) - Forbes Now</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/07/02/here-are-all-the-video-games-releasing-in-july-2018/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMrToejx_lskJh6YjMpz49MqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 16:22:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/07/02/here-are-all-the-video-games-releasing-in-july-2018/" target="_blank"&gt;Here Are All The Video Games Releasing In July (2018)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Man’s Sky is coming to Xbox One in July. July is a pretty slow month when it comes to video game releases, but there are actually some pretty big and important games coming out this July, especially if you’re on Xbox One or Nintendo Switch. It’s still a pretty slow month as far as game releases go, but if none of these games interests you at least you can catch up on the backlog!

When it was released, the ability to play with your friends or run into other players was nowhere to be found, but now, that’s about to change, almost two years later. July 24th brings both No Man’s Sky to Xbox One, and also its big NEXT update, which Hello Games promises is the largest one for the game to date.

Sea of Thieves is one of Microsoft’s biggest exclusive video games of 2018, but it’s already being unfavorably compared to No Man’s Sky when that game launched as a PS4 exclusive. (It’s actually one of Microsoft’s only exclusives for 2018.) While players are certainly divided, the game has been widely panned by critics for its lack of content, much like No Man’s Sky was when it launched on the PS4. Here are five of the biggest problems with Rare’s strange little pirate game. 1. It feels like an Early Access title. Unless you obtained Sea of Thieves thr...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>'No Man's Sky' Is Coming To Xbox One And Getting Another Big Free Update - Forbes Now</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/03/29/no-mans-sky-is-coming-to-xbox-one-and-getting-another-big-free-update/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEC0Kspn0-u1dT_iYpoOg1SsqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 14:23:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/03/29/no-mans-sky-is-coming-to-xbox-one-and-getting-another-big-free-update/" target="_blank"&gt;'No Man's Sky' Is Coming To Xbox One And Getting Another Big Free Update&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Man’s Sky At long last, whatever Faustian bargain Hello Games had with Sony appears to be fully dissolved, and No Man’s Sky will soon becoming to Xbox One, thanks to distribution from 505 Games. The announcement was made today, along with “No Man’s Sky Next,” which appears to be the working title of a new, big update for the game slated to hit in 2018, as Hello Games continues to toil to right wrongs and expand the game into what everyone had hoped it would be originally. No Man’s Sky is still a name that will make people wince, like when I compared Sea of Thieves to it recently, but in ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>Xbox One's 'Sea Of Thieves' Is No More Than 10% Of A Finished Game - Forbes Now</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/03/21/xbox-ones-sea-of-thieves-is-no-more-than-10-of-a-finished-game/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEFUH-49rzF4oK0SRC9nX_A0qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:29:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/03/21/xbox-ones-sea-of-thieves-is-no-more-than-10-of-a-finished-game/" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox One's 'Sea Of Thieves' Is No More Than 10% Of A Finished Game&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea of Thieves As expected, Sea of Thieves was released yesterday and the game is….very much like what we’ve seen in the early tests the past few weeks and months. There was this running pre-defense of Sea of Thieves by Xbox fans that secret depths were lurking under the surface, that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg but that simply is not the case. Sea of Thieves feels like a good deal when rolled into Microsoft’s $10-a-month-for-a-whole-bunch-of-games Xbox Game Pass, but less so when you realize this is being sold as a $60 title to most players.
