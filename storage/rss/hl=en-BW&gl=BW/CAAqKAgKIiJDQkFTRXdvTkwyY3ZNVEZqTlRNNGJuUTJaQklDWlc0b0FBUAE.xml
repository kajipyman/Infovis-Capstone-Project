Doing these little fact checks is even easier using a voice assistant. In fact, asking questions is one of the main uses for digital assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple’s Siri.

First, it’ll ask if there’s a particular genre or tempo you’re after, then it’ll start offering samples of different playlists for you to accept or reject. In some cases, Alexa will seek more guidance–for instance, by asking if you want something laid back or upbeat–and you can also try to proactively narrow things down each time Alexa suggests another playlist. “...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.fastcompany.com">Fast Company</source></item><item><title>Here's Why Apple Had No Choice But To Bring Its Music Service To Amazon Alexa Smart Speakers - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/12/03/heres-why-apple-had-no-choice-but-to-bring-its-music-service-to-amazon-alexa-smart-speakers/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEBvW8Jfkms8RnjFwRoOHD9MqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 01:42:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/12/03/heres-why-apple-had-no-choice-but-to-bring-its-music-service-to-amazon-alexa-smart-speakers/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's Why Apple Had No Choice But To Bring Its Music Service To Amazon Alexa Smart Speakers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Music will now play on the 100 million Amazon Echo smart speakers In a surprise announcement on Friday, Amazon and Apple unveiled that Apple Music will start playing on Amazon Alexa speakers.

Speakers enabled with artificial intelligence software like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Google’s Assistant can recommend products to shoppers. But a new study by Cornell University researchers found that people who searched for their own products online explored three times as many options as customers who accepted recommendations from their smart-home devices. That’s good news for products at the top of the recommendation list.

Smart displays like the Echo Showand Google Home Hub are the best new takes on the theme, and Facebook's Portal is the oddest.

Right now, the perfect solution is 75 percent off (yep, you read that right), costing $50 (rather than $200). The Look has many of the same features as other Echo products, including virtual assistant Alexa, who can help tell you the forecast for the day, order products from Amazon and much more. This deal has been live for most of Cyber Week, so I don’t think the Look will be at...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Alexa, who is the killer? - Fast Company</title><link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90268097/alexa-for-the-prosecution-amazon-device-audio-sought-as-evidence-in-double-homicide</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEKEbD85_j1lKog7Ah-DXVaUqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowlacCMKBPMOGbAg</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 18:31:21 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90268097/alexa-for-the-prosecution-amazon-device-audio-sought-as-evidence-in-double-homicide" target="_blank"&gt;Alexa, who is the killer?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities investigating a suspected double homicide in Farmington, New Hampshire, noticed an Amazon Echo in the home where two women were apparently killed, and a judge has now ordered Amazon to turn over three days’ worth of audio from the device, TechCrunch reports. It’s unclear if the company has turned over the data. A search warrant also orders Amazon to turn over any data identifying phones paired with the device during that period. Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson told Fast Company that the company does not release customer information without a “valid and binding legal ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.fastcompany.com">Fast Company</source></item><item><title>Google wants its virtual assistant in every room of your house - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/tech/google-demo-home/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHxsL3khd4-jaXWpBBg69vwqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMKrxrwU</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 18:45:15 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/tech/google-demo-home/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google wants its virtual assistant in every room of your house&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is teasing the future it thinks you want. Inside a beautiful multi-million-dollar house in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company set up a model smart home outfitted with every Google device and connected home gadget imaginable. The one-day demo highlighted an assortment of new Google Assistant features coming in the weeks ahead. There are recipe recommendations on smart displays and custom alarms for children recorded by actors from popular cartoons. The tour was also a chance to see how Google (GOOGL) imagines people living, parenting and even sleeping surrounded by its products. ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item><item><title>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Review: A Great Way To Make Dumb TVs Smart - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2018/11/13/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review-a-great-way-to-make-dumb-tvs-smart/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJXycGiKmABY-rstc-y60OYqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMJGBAg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2018/11/13/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review-a-great-way-to-make-dumb-tvs-smart/" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Review: A Great Way To Make Dumb TVs Smart&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like its rather prosaic name, Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K isn’t messing about. It’s on an admirably straightforward mission to turn your dumb-ass TV into something a whole lot smarter without a) costing you much money or b) ruining the slinky looks of your prized 4K television. Even better, it also wants to give you access to levels of picture and sound quality you may not have experienced via an online service before. First, let’s consider its price. Despite costing only $49.99 (£49.99), it introduces a wealth of key new features you don’t get on the only $10 cheaper HD version of the Fi...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Will you be getting a smart home spy for Christmas? - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/10/spy-christmas-smart-home-facebook-portal-google-home-hub-amazon-show-alexa</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJZ69R1JDS1Lym-BEqdHA7oqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDlkko</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 15:00:42 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/10/spy-christmas-smart-home-facebook-portal-google-home-hub-amazon-show-alexa" target="_blank"&gt;Will you be getting a smart home spy for Christmas?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve so far withstood the temptation to install a smart speaker in your home, worried about the potential privacy pitfalls and a bit embarrassed about the notion of chatting aimlessly to an inanimate object, brace yourselves. This Christmas, the world’s biggest tech giants, including Amazon, Google and Facebook, are making another bid for your living room, announcing a range of new devices that resemble tablets you can talk to. Facebook’s is called Portal, Google’s the Home Hub, and Amazon has unveiled the second version of its Echo Show.

Alexa was already available on select laptops and desktops, and Microsoft’s own Cortana voice assistant recently gained the ability to speak with Alexa, but the new app cuts out the middlemen and lets anyone install Alexa directly. The app supports hands-free voice commands as long as it’s running, though some PCs don’t allow this. (There is an option to press Control-Shift-A to summon Alexa instead.) As The Verge reports, the Alexa Windows app does have some limitations for now.

Alexa has evolved from being essentially a hands-free gimmick to become one of the most advanced virtual assistants on the market. Just look at the figures. In 2016, Alexa could only respond to around 4,000 commands. By 2017, that number had increased to 35,000. Alexa is picking up new skills and vocabulary faster than a Human four-year-old, at this rate! The number of tasks Alexa can accomplish is only going to continue to grow and expand at an increasing rate as smart technology becomes more evolved.
