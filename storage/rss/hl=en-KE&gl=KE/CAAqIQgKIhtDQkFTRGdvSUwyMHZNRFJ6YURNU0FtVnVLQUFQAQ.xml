Pointed barbs from critics claim that the medical system has “stopped focusing on health or even science” and is single-mindedly focused on its own profits. A report from the respected Commonwealth Fund finds that the United States, “despite having the most expensive health care system, ranks last overall among eleven industrialized countries on measures of health system quality, efficiency, access to care, equity, and healthy lives.” And yet, despite flaws in the system, you don’t need t...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Man coughs up blood clot in shape of bronchial tree - ABC News</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-08/man-coughs-up-blood-clot-in-shape-of-bronchial-tree/10597114</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEIZCX0h2cT2InyaU1WXEEekqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDciw4</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 01:24:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-08/man-coughs-up-blood-clot-in-shape-of-bronchial-tree/10597114" target="_blank"&gt;Man coughs up blood clot in shape of bronchial tree&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man has stunned doctors by coughing up a 15-centimetre-wide blood clot from his lungs in the near-perfect shape of his right bronchial tree. The mysterious, cherry-red cast resembled a piece of coral, and an image of it has gone viral after appearing in The New England Journal of Medicine. It came from a 36-year-old man with end-stage heart failure who spat out the medical anomaly in one piece during an extreme bout of coughing in hospital.

The widespread take-up of the human papilloma virus vaccine, for instance, should mean that thousands of people will in future not develop cervical, oral and anal cancer, so not need surgery.
