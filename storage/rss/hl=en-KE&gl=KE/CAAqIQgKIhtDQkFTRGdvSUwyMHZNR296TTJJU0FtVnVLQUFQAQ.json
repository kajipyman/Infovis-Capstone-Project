The groundbreaking study involves 420 couples in total from seven different countries including Chile, England, Scotland, Kenya, Sweden and Italy.

But it is designed for men to shoulder some more responsibility for birth control. Literally. The phrase \u201cput one\u2019s back into it\u201d typically means \u201cmake a strenuous effort\u201d, according to Dictionary.com. And yes, effort during sex is often appreciated.
