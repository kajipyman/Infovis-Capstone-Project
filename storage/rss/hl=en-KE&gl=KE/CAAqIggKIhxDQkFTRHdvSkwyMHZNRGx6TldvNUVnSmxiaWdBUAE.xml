Drax has amended the terms of its impending acquisition of Scottish Power’s pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation to mitigate risks in the UK’s capacity market. The group announced the deal in October, and still plans to pay £702m for the portfolio, but has now agreed on a risk-sharing mechanism worth £36m with Spanish energy group Iberdrola, covering the period from January 1 2019 to September 30 2019.

Players on the Oakland Raiders have to deal with the new federal tax law changes — and playing in the state with the highest income tax. Harry How/Getty Images Because of changes to the tax law that went into effect this year, professional athletes might need to put their CPAs on speed dial.

The upper house’s economic affairs committee — which includes two former chancellors, Lord Darling and Lord Lamont — recommended that the government undertake a full review of HMRC’s powers. It also urged the government to scrap plans that would further extend the tax authority’s powers through, for example, increasing the time HMRC has to assess an individual’s offshore tax affairs, to 12 years. “This would p...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item><item><title>How Much In Taxes Will I Owe When Selling My Home? - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2018/12/07/tax-selling-my-home/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEvtKRxKoZ1sEBX9_QgHKGgqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMJGBAg</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2018/12/07/tax-selling-my-home/" target="_blank"&gt;How Much In Taxes Will I Owe When Selling My Home?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much in capital gains taxes will you owe when selling yoru primary residence?
