HMC schools, which include Eton, Harrow and Winchester, allow wealthy parents who can afford school fees to subsidise the education of those from less well-off backgrounds, according to Mike Buchanan. He pointed to the recent decision taken by Millfield School in Somerset to cut fees by 10 per cent amid concerns they are no longer affordable to middle classes.

The student then became unresponsive. A teacher tried performing CPR, and the boy was rushed to the hospital but did not survive.

Jennifer Sinclair, the newly-appointed principal of Manchester Elementary School in Omaha, Nebraska, unleashed a crackdown on Christmas-related music, activities, sweets and decorations in a 3-page memo she penned to teachers.

On one side, the jagged summits of the Alps, on the other, the small towns of Lausanne, Vevey, and Montreux. Everywhere, mansions and palaces emerge, facing the stunning views. Swiss tourism is booming, but there are few candidates to help run these hotels. Enter Jacques Tschumi, Director of the Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne who imagines a local hotel school.
