According to The American Pet Products Association, almost 85 million households have a pet and over the last 30 years pet ownership has gone from 56% to 68% of all households. Some of the changes in pet ownership are due to technology and the advent of online purchasing. But most of the growth is because of changes in culture. As millennial and Generation Z consumers have come into adulthood, they have embraced the pet-owning and pet-loving lifestyles to a far greater extent than their elder...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Tracking West Island's last feral cat - ABC News</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2018-11-26/last-feral-cat-on-west-island-due-to-indigenous-ranger-program/10511880</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPBzL5n6UpLp5a68Tsff2XEqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDciw4</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 21:54:26 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2018-11-26/last-feral-cat-on-west-island-due-to-indigenous-ranger-program/10511880" target="_blank"&gt;Tracking West Island's last feral cat&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Brann On the remote West Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Indigenous rangers say after years of hard work, there is now just one feral cat left on the island. An eradication program by the local Li-Anthawirriyarra Sea Rangers has used old and new technologies to eradicate the feral felines, with great success. While 1080 baits had been the main weapon since the project started in 2011, some cats wised up to the poisonous baits, which led rangers to try other methods to mop up the island's last few cats.

A vet told me this as he stretched my cat's back leg, adding that he could feel a bit of arthritis in it. The diagnosis wasn't unsurprising — my kitty is pushing 13 years old — but he advised keeping a close eye on her. In cats, conditions such as arthritis can go undetected until it's so bad that it's almost untreatable, the vet added. That got me thinking: pets can't explicitly tell us that they feel sore or sick. And the signs aren't always obvious. So what should pet owners be looking for?

The secret: Tiny hooks that spring up on the tongue — with scoops built in to carry saliva deep into all that fur.

Former “Malcolm in the Middle” star Frankie Muniz says his five-story brownstone sustained major flood damage ― and his cat is the culprit. In a Twitter vent last week, the 32-year-old actor said he returned home from his uncle’s funeral in France to catastrophic destruction in his home ― several floors under water. “All because my cat accidentally turned on a sink a few days ago while we were gone,” he wrote. Muniz, who currently hosts “Dancing With the Stars: Juniors,” added: “I know this sounds ridiculous, but I swear it’s true.” Muniz said he cried more over two...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>Residents fear erratic raccoons may have rabies, police say they are just drunk - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rabies-virus-drunk-raccoons-rabid-animals-death-police-a8634911.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEAzMdMQhRNUt6zDh9OkifQgqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCtyxU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2018 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rabies-virus-drunk-raccoons-rabid-animals-death-police-a8634911.html" target="_blank"&gt;Residents fear erratic raccoons may have rabies, police say they are just drunk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid animals are, of course, no laughing matter. The rabies virus can infect the central nervous system, resulting in disease and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that happens after a host of increasingly serious symptoms: partial paralysis, agitation, hallucinations, hydrophobia. A British man and two children died in Morocco after they were bitten by a rabid cat. So it was not surprising that when people in the city of Milton, West Virginia, saw raccoons behaving weirdly, they involved the local police. Officers staked out the area where the suspect...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Rescuers field 5,000 calls in bid to save farm animals, pets from California's deadly fires - ABC News</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-13/california-fires-farm-animals-and-pets-rescued/10494216</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEO0l7wXgN9GN3hd4pbMIsecqFwgEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDD7kIkG</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:51:03 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-13/california-fires-farm-animals-and-pets-rescued/10494216" target="_blank"&gt;Rescuers field 5,000 calls in bid to save farm animals, pets from California's deadly fires&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drove of donkeys, a herd of horses and even a large tortoise are among the farm animals and pets rescued by a host of volunteers in California as the most devastating wildfire in the US state's history ravages the landscape.

"We are making sure we are always taking the nutritional high ground," Petco CEO Ron Coughlin told The Associated Press.

The horse appeared to have jumped in to escape the flames, and was caught in the pool cover. He had been checking on a neighbor's house to see if it was still standing when he discovered the horse, Hill wrote in a Facebook post.

Lyla belongs to Myron Lyskanycz, CEO of the pet food company Halo. The business has sold both meat and vegan ranges of pet food for six years, and its meat-free products now account for 20 percent of dog food sales.
