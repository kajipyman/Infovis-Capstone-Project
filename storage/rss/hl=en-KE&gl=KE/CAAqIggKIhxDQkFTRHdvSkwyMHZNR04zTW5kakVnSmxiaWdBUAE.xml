That result was an improvement on the 2:06:21 he had run in London six months previously -- at the time a British record.

The race for a sub-two-hour marathon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 6, Eliud Kipchoge ran 2:00:25 for a marathon in Monza, Italy, as part of Nike's "Breaking2" project. Although over two-and-half minutes faster than the current record, the conditions of the run mean that Kipchoge's time may not count as a world record should Nike apply for official status. The history of competitive running is measured out by milestones. Roger Bannister's four-minute mile, Jim Hines's 10-second 100m, and Paula Radcliffe's unprecedented 2:15:25 marathon all redefined the barriers of human potential.

It's also the time that needs to be slashed off the current marathon world record to break the elusive "two-hour marathon" barrier. But let's get one thing straight — it's not going to be easy. The current record of 2:02:57 was set by Dennis Kimetto of Kenya in 2014. In 2013, his countryman Wilson Kipsang ran 2:03:23, and in 2011 Patrick Makau ran 2:03:38.

That meant knowing he was the fastest athlete in the field. That he was the strongest. And, if it came to it, knowing he could beat up any of his rivals. So when he steps on to the start line at the Chicago marathon on Sunday, Farah intends to make people fear him again. “It is similar to a fight,” says the 10-times Olympic and world champion. “You need to know people’s weaknesses and strengths so, like a fight...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Mo Farah claims first marathon win in Chicago setting European record time - The Telegraph</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2018/10/07/mo-farah-claims-first-marathon-win-chicago-setting-european/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMMu_M0uEqlYMM5H9UckWSUqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowm6R6MMKqCTDh77kF</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2018 15:34:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2018/10/07/mo-farah-claims-first-marathon-win-chicago-setting-european/" target="_blank"&gt;Mo Farah claims first marathon win in Chicago setting European record time&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone assumed Mo Farah was only in this for a final few hefty pay cheques they should think again.

Yet deep down the Kenyan’s victory, his third here, merely confirmed what most spectators already knew: he is the finest 26.2-miler of all time. A much greater surprise was to be found further down The Mall, where Mo Farah was holding on for third in a British record of 2hr 6min 21sec.

The 35-year-old Farah is yet to decide on his next race over 26.2 miles but the likelihood is he will choose an autumn marathon in Chicago or New York – with Dubai in January an outside bet – before returning to the British capital next April.

Eliud Kipchoge has a stronger claim than most to be the greatest marathon runner in history. The 33-year-old Kenyan has won nine of his 10 races over the distance, breezed to the Olympic title in 2016, and last year ran 2hr 0min 25sec, the fastest time over 26.2 miles. True, it didn’t count as an official world record as Kipchoge was helped by a phalanx of pacemakers, who subbed in and out of the race (which is against the rules) but it was still an astonishing performance.
