State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that the new mission opened Sunday. "This historic event reflects Somalia's progress in recent years and is another step forward in formalizing U.S. diplomatic engagement in Mogadishu," the statement read. The U.S. formally recognized Somalia's new federal government in 2013, but has based its diplomatic outpost at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.
