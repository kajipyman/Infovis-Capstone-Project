Reproductive rights are one area where parity is far off, and you don’t need to go far to witness women being subjected to open, regular abuse. Intimidation occurs daily outside family planning clinics nationwide, in increasingly virulent protests by the so-called religious, aimed at stopping women having abort...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Anti-social behaviour ruling could halt anti-abortion protests outside clinics - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/anti-social-behaviour-ruling-could-halt-anti-abortion-protests-outside-clinics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEDC7nNwf4ykjTMfFVnuIGAAqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDlkko</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2017 17:00:34 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/anti-social-behaviour-ruling-could-halt-anti-abortion-protests-outside-clinics" target="_blank"&gt;Anti-social behaviour ruling could halt anti-abortion protests outside clinics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-abortion protests outside clinics across the UK could be halted using anti-social behaviour legislation, a Labour MP has said, after her council took a significant decision to stop a group from approaching women at a west London clinic.

In the first case of its kind, Ealing council will debate the move after a petition from local pro-choice group, Sister Supporter, which demanded action to stop anti-abortion protesters holding vigils six days a week outside the clinic and approaching patients.
