Hopes were high when South Sudan declared independence from Sudan in 2011, but the eruption of civil war in 2013 has left the world’s youngest nation mired in violence and underdevelopment. Well over 50,000 people have been killed and more than 1.6 million displaced since the conflict began.

Suddenly, the sound of gunshots pierced the air. Teachers yelled to the students to run and hide. “We were running where we could not hear the gunfire,” he recalls. The year was 1985 and rebels from southern Sudan were waging a war for independence against the government in the north. Dut escaped that day with others who fled into the bush.

From Syria and Libya to South Sudan and Somalia, the illicit supply of weapons has fuelled conflict, reversed socio-economic development gains to pre-1960s levels, and undermined successive efforts to broker peace.

Uganda’s Financial Intelligence Authority - set up to track illicit money - says it lacks resources to stem the flow. Tax evasion, money laundering, and related corruption are costing Uganda at least $1 billion a year, according to Global Financial Integrity. The Washington, D.C.-based non-profit said in a September report that tax evasion from imports and exports alone cost Uganda $6.7 billion dollars from 2006 to 2015.
