When Angela Merkel let more than 800,000 refugees into the country in the summer of 2015, few could have predicted the fall-out that would follow. Over the past three years, her government has been embroiled in bitter political infighting and the surge in support for right-wing policies and the populist party Alternative for Deutschland (AFD) has led commentators to question just how much this decision led to her departure.

The land down under has cycled through five PMs since 2013. Morrison, who became Australia’s 30th prime minister in August, had his debut meeting with the German chancellor at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Merkel reminded her fellow party members that experience has shown "how much strength and momentum we can develop" when faced with difficulties.
