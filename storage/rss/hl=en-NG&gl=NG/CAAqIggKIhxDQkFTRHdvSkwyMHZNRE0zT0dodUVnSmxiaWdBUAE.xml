Chelsea have fallen out of form in recent weeks and Sarri-ball isn't having quite the effect it was earlier in the season. Pep Guardiola is a master at figuring out how to stop his opponents playing their game and with City flying high in the league, could do some damage, if not end Sarris' ambitious title ambitions.

He needs a team to play like one, for individuals to act as though fused together, working towards a collective goal, showing heart, fight and focus. This current Man Utd team is occasionally half-decent and has some massive names who turn up sporadically, but as a unit, it appears devoid of identity. If Mourinho is trying to fire up his players and have the team play in his image, he's either not doing it very well or has a squad full of the wrong type of person.

The Italian added that talks over a new deal for the player take place every week at the club. The Belgium playmaker's current deal runs until June 2020 and the 27-year-old has admitted his quandary over whether to re-sign with the Blues or seek a "dream" move to Real Madrid. Sarri says Hazard is considering an offer from Chelsea, rumoured to be worth up to £350,000 per week.

Jose Mourinho said he was confident De Gea would stay and commit his future after hailing the Spaniard as the “best goalkeeper in the world” following his stunning save against Young Boys shortly before Fellaini’s winner. United must trigger a 12-month option on De Gea’s current contract, which expires at the end of this season, before Jan. 1 to prevent him from being able to talk to...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.telegraph.co.uk">The Telegraph</source></item><item><title>Unai Emery admits Tottenham better than Arsenal as he ranks Mauricio Pochettino alongside Pep Guardiola and Diego Simeone - The Telegraph</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/12/01/unai-emery-admits-tottenham-better-arsenal-ranks-mauricio-pochettino/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMq9WOPn-8l8xB2JM1vyB14qFwgEKg4IACoGCAowm6R6MMKqCTDKzbcF</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/12/01/unai-emery-admits-tottenham-better-arsenal-ranks-mauricio-pochettino/" target="_blank"&gt;Unai Emery admits Tottenham better than Arsenal as he ranks Mauricio Pochettino alongside Pep Guardiola and Diego Simeone&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenal have to accept that Tottenham Hotspur have been better than them in recent years, Unai Emery has said, as he hailed his friend Mauricio Pochettino as among the best managers in the world.

Rashford and Lingard have netted three and two goals respectively for England this season, having been part of the Three Lions' run to the semi-finals of the summer's World Cup - a tournament Pogba won with France, scoring in the final.

Hughes’s position appears increasingly vulnerable after a dismal start to the season that has left his Southampton side rooted in the bottom three of the Premier League table having mustered just one win and ten goals in the opening 13 league games.
