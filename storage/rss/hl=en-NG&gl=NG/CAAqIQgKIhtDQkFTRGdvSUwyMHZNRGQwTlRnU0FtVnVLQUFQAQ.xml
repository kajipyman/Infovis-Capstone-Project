(AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that Congress should provide all the money he wants for his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, and he called illegal immigration a "threat to the well-being of every American community." Trump spoke hours after signing a short-term spending bill that covers key government departments for two more weeks, until Dec. 21, setting up a pre-Christmas showdown over the wall. The president wants the next spending package to include at least $5 billion for the proposed wall.

Some observers are concerned that the changes made it possible for more people to apply for absentee ballots.

But the prospect of Manchin, who famously used a rifle to shoot a greenhouse gas emission cap-and-trade bill in a 2010 campaign ad, as the committee’s senior Democrat next year did not appear to alarm some of the party’s most influential voices in the Senate on climate change. “I think he’ll find a way to work ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>Ocasio-Cortez and Trump Jr. trade social media barbs - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/aoc-tweet-donald-trump-jr-large-brain-subpoenas/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEM7DFnwgIoNTbwOAAKCHUnMqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMJrUpgU</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 05:06:52 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/aoc-tweet-donald-trump-jr-large-brain-subpoenas/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ocasio-Cortez and Trump Jr. trade social media barbs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted Donald Trump Jr. on Friday for insulting her and in turn drew the ire of conservatives who saw her counterattack as a power-abusing threat to the eldest son of President Donald Trump.
