Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota struck in four second half minutes to stun the visitors who now sit 10 points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City. Ruben Loftus-Cheek's deflected opener had put the visitors in control before they slipped to a second straight away defeat after gifting Wolves a way back.

Maurizio Sarri’s men looked relatively untroubled for 59 minutes and led through a goal from Ruben Loftus-Cheek. But Kepa allowed a Raul Jimenez shot to creep past him on 59 minutes to trigger a memorable Wolves fightback that was completed when Diogo Jota side-footed home from a Matt Doherty cross.
