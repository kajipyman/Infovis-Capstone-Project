Corker, the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is cobbling together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats in an attempt to force the Trump administration to do something that would undermine a key tenet of its foreign policy: acknowledge that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “I know he did it.

Marco Rubio said Wednesday there is "no doubt" that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in "directing" the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. "Just from what we know about Saudi Arabia, what we know about the crown prince and what we know about this murder leaves you with no doubt that the crown prince, at a minimum, knew about it and condoned it, and perhaps at worst was actually involved in directing it," Rubio told CNN's John Berman on "New Day."

Thus begins the fight to eviscerate President Donald Trump’s corrupt bargain with the vicious and volatile Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). The immediate impetus for the Senate action was the grisly murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives at the direction of MBS ― and Trump’s mendacious and morally repulsive embrace of the crown prince in the killing’s aftermath. “The world is a very danger...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>A bro-shake with Putin, a talking-to from Macron: The Saudi prince’s less-than-royal treatment at the G20 - infobae</title><link>https://www.infobae.com/america/g20-summit-2018/2018/11/30/saudi-prince-appears-far-from-isolated-at-g20/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGsDvHxFrL18tvsNDeCYdxsqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowyPhzMO2BDDDCt60D</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:36:28 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.infobae.com/america/g20-summit-2018/2018/11/30/saudi-prince-appears-far-from-isolated-at-g20/" target="_blank"&gt;A bro-shake with Putin, a talking-to from Macron: The Saudi prince’s less-than-royal treatment at the G20&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;infobae&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is in the middle of an international controversy. (Reuters) Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was once feted in Western capitals as a new breed of economic and social reformer. Then came the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul on Oct. 2 – and with it, a whirlwind of international controversy and criticism that has engulfed the young Saudi royal. This week, less than two months after the killing of Khashoggi, Mohammed traveled to Buenos Aires for a G20 meeting that brought together leaders from the world's top economies.
