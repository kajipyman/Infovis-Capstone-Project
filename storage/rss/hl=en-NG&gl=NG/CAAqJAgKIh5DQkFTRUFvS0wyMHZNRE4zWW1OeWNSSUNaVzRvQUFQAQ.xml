The rule was: don’t rile Didier. When he was angry he seemed to play even better. If his temper was up he was like the Hulk, ploughing through everything in his path, impossible to knock off the ball, a real force of nature.

Now slightly more than a third of the way through, we have a large enough sample size of matches to properly assess how well teams and players are performing. One of football's newer statistics - expected goals, or xG for short - shines particularly brightly in this scenario because it can expose themes you cannot spot from simply looking at the league table. For those new to the term - or in need of a refresher - expected goals is a measure of how likely a player is to score from their shooting position.
