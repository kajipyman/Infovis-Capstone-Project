Three-time World Cup winner Pele, 78, is widely acknowledged as among the best – if not the best – to have graced the game, with Diego Maradona often seen as his closest competitor for GOAT status. But Messi’s decade at the pinnacle of the game, alongside generational great Cristiano Ronaldo, have seen more and more observers applying the all-time great tag to the 31-year-old Argentinian.

Here is a look at the records set and broken during the World Cup in Russia, and what it tells us about the tournament: PLENTY OF GOALS With just one scoreless draw in 64 games, Russia's World Cup has been far from dull. By the time France and Denmark delivered a boring 0-0 draw in the group stage, 35 games had been played with at least one goal scored, breaking a World Cup record that had stood for 64 years.

To be fair, the football universe has long been taking notice of French wonderkid Kylian Mbappe, but when you're leaving full internationals in your dust in a round-of-16 World Cup match, it's patently obvious you're coming of age in scary fashion.
