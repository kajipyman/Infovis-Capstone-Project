Food and Agricultural Organization said Wednesday as it renewed appeals for better policies and technologies to reach "zero hunger." Population growth requires supplies of more nutritious food at affordable prices, but increasing farm output is hard given the "fragility of the natural resource base" since humans have outstripped Earth's carrying capacity in terms of land, water and climate change, the report said.

The government recorded a 170 per cent increase in the number of suspected cholera cases, up from 497 in June to 1342 in August, the charity said. The spike is in line with national data that also shows a steady rise of suspected cholera cases across Yemen.

Setbacks are shrugged off and mortality contemplated with disdain. “I never saw a Somali who showed any fear of death,” wrote Gerald Hanley, the Irish author, who lived among them in the Forties.
