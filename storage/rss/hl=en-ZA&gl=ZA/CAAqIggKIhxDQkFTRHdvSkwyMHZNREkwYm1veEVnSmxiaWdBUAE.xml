Alastair Cook’s farewell century was a moment to stand the test of time. Cook had so many standing ovations, even he looked embarrassed by all the fuss. Joe Root made a hundred batting back at No 4, a moment of deeper significance for the team’s future, Cook added one final display of dogged stubbornness in scoring his 33rd Test century.
