He also said that the party should look to leave the EU in with a managed no-deal Brexit and try and organise a free trade deal from the outside. - Read more Rudd attacks ‘flouncing’ Tory Brexiteers as leadership rivals jostle Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he said Ms May would have...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Brexit: Amber Rudd attacks 'flouncing' Tory eurosceptics as leadership rivals jostle - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-amber-rudd-conservatives-theresa-may-tory-eu-boris-johnson-conservatives-a8673591.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEDQ5oRN1o2oGIml_fEGOMngqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTDyxv0F</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 10:13:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-amber-rudd-conservatives-theresa-may-tory-eu-boris-johnson-conservatives-a8673591.html" target="_blank"&gt;Brexit: Amber Rudd attacks 'flouncing' Tory eurosceptics as leadership rivals jostle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has hit out male Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done.

Constantin Barbutu left a number of women anry and living in fear after riding up behind women them while they were walking, running or cycling alone before smacking or groping them. But the judge at Hove Crown Court said the Romanian dish washer had escaped a prison sentence because he was so "severely intellectually impaired" that he would not cope behind bars. Having initially denied 21 charges of sexual assault, Barbutu pleaded guilty on the first day o...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>UK businesses could collapse as a result of Theresa May's plan to slash immigration after Brexit, CBI warns - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/businesses-collapse-brexit-immigration-plans-theresa-may-cbi-warning-a8671341.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGL8qelUMv4RTAmncXyXkVwqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCtyxU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 20:10:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/businesses-collapse-brexit-immigration-plans-theresa-may-cbi-warning-a8671341.html" target="_blank"&gt;UK businesses could collapse as a result of Theresa May's plan to slash immigration after Brexit, CBI warns&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theresa May's plans to curb immigration after Brexit could result in businesses collapsing and jobs being lost, the head of the CBI has warned. Carolyn Fairbairn said measures aimed at restricting low-skilled immigration could be as damaging to the economy as the oil price shock in the 1970s. The CBI director-general also warned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, claiming it would require “dramatic decisions” about what urgent supplies were able to arrive through Dover. The prime minister used her speech at the CBI conference in November to claim her new immigration system would stop EU ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Whatever his motives, Nigel Farage is right on Ukip - Financial Times</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/dc7238d4-f898-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEDsaSt8e4PEVD0QL-u_xzN4qFwgEKg8IACoHCAow-4fWBzD4z0gwwtp6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 18:51:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc7238d4-f898-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c" target="_blank"&gt;Whatever his motives, Nigel Farage is right on Ukip&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anyone else, perhaps, Nigel Farage is responsible for Brexit. The former leader of the UK Independence party has devoted 20 years to stirring up anger against the EU by promoting falsehoods, twisting facts and stoking nativist — occasionally xenophobic — sentiments. Despite failing to be elected as an MP eight times, Mr Farage has a claim to being the most effective British politician since Tony Blair. Now he has quit the party he led on and off for a decade. Deprived of a purpose after the 2016 vote for Brexit, Ukip has morphed fully into a far-right force under its latest leader...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item><item><title>Theresa May has lost control of Brexit - Financial Times</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/b91dd274-f895-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENXb2FiPGZnhES3kvy5CORgqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow-4fWBzD4z0gwgtt6</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 05:01:07 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b91dd274-f895-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c" target="_blank"&gt;Theresa May has lost control of Brexit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is what they meant by taking back control. Theresa May’s government has drawn up plans to allocate space on European ferries arriving at the British port of Dover. Trucks carrying medicines will get permits to make the crossing from Calais; so too, perhaps, those with components for vital business supply chains. Britain’s consumers have been warned. There will not be enough room for luxuries such as fresh fruit and vegetables. Crashing out of the EU in March without a deal would see the restoration overnight of Britain’s national sovereignty. This surely would be Brexit at its pures...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item></channel></rss>
