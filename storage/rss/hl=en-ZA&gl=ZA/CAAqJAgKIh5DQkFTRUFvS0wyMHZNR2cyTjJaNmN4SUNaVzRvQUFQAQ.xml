Mickey Arthur said after the first Test here in Abu Dhabi that Pakistan cricket had the ability to move on, and it looks like they've moved on without learning a single thing from it.

(2:52) Osman spent the first half of his life pretending he discovered reverse swing with a tennis ball half-covered with electrical tape. The second half of his life was spent trying, and failing, to find spiritual fulfillment in the world of Pakistani advertising and marketing.

It was a day that Yasir Shah threatened to hijack once more after an extraordinary pre-lunch burst that reduced New Zealand to 72 for 4, with three wickets lost for two runs. Equally, it was a day that Kane Williamson looked to have salvaged for his side with a phenomenally gritty partnership alongside BJ Watling, who finished unbeaten on 42 off 180 balls, having come in to bat all the way back in the first session. In the end, it was perhaps a day that concluded with as little to separate the sides as there had been at the toss, ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricinfo</source></item><item><title>Yasir Shah's dip and drift 'as good as I've seen' - Craig McMillan - ESPNCricinfo</title><link>http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25404933/yasir-shah-dip-drift-good-seen-craig-mcmillan</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEB4FCaQRIgr3MWveBO31CdEqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow7qimATDOxAowov85</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 15:59:22 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25404933/yasir-shah-dip-drift-good-seen-craig-mcmillan" target="_blank"&gt;Yasir Shah's dip and drift 'as good as I've seen' - Craig McMillan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ESPNCricinfo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig McMillan, the New Zealand batting coach, has urged his batsmen to come up with "precise and clear" plans against Yasir Shah ahead of the third Test against Pakistan, which begins on December 3 in Abu Dhabi.

Shah took 10 New Zealand wickets in a single day on Monday to leave the Kiwis facing the threat of an innings defeat after day three of the second Test in Dubai. Shah's eight first-innings wickets came at the cost of just 41 runs, giving him the third-best bowling figures by a Pakistani in Test matches.
