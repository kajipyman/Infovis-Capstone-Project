One recent story, for instance, focused on the disturbing thoughts that haunt new parents, including feeling like you want to hurt your baby. At the same time, the site is generally supportive of women, rather than trying to tear them down with misogyny, racism, and ageism.

Damien Chazelle’s musical might be set in contemporary Hollywood but the crossover is apparent. With extravagant set-pieces, nostalgia and music heavy scenes, it’s Bollywood at heart.

Even when you have one of the most recognized faces in India, if the film isn’t outstanding, it will likely become film fodder. Or, to put subtly, a wash. Making a glam Hollywood debut, Baywatch was a big test of Priyanka Chopra’s star power in her home country, considering reviews have not been kind. Opening a week after the theatrical release in the U.S., the R-rated movie remake of the campy TV series could barely stay afloat in India.
