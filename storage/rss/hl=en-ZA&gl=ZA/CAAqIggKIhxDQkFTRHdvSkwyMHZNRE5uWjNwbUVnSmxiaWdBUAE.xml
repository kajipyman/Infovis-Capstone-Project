Late last month, the general-secretary of Tunisia's ruling party Nidaa Tounes, Slim Riahi, initiated legal proceedings in a Tunis military tribunal against current Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and a number of other officials, accusing them of plotting to stage a coup against President Beji Caid Essebsi.

Tories furious at the election fiasco will demand changes to her leadership style and concessions on key policy areas including Brexit. In a sign of the impossible task ahead, the weakened leader must appease both those who believe voters have rejected a hard Brexit, and others demanding she plough on with a tough approach.

"At the moment the team is together and we’re getting on with the job of delivering what we believe the British people want us to do,” she said.

The suspicion of scandal over favoritism for a friend's business and missteps by cabinet ministers have taken a toll on Abe, who until recently was favored to win a third three-year term as party leader, and hence, premier when his current term expires in September 2018.

Kishida, 60, is set to be tapped for the post of LDP policy chief. He has been foreign minister since Abe returned to power in 2012 and is widely regarded in political circles as a potential rival for the leadership of the LDP and thus the premiership.
