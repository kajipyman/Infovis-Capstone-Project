How will this pitch go? Will a big product gamble pay off? Is this the right hire? Having started two companies, one of which was acquired by a publicly traded company, I can assure you that these questions don’t go away, and, as your company scales, there will be even more riding on your shoulders. It can be easy to try to answer these questions on your own, but the fact of the matter is that we’ve all been there.
