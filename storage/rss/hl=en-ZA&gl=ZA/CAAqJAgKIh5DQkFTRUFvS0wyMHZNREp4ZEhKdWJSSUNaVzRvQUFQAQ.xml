Wednesday's raid in the northern suburb Saxonworld comes as the country waits to see if President Jacob Zuma would resign after being asked to do so by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party. The Gupta family, an Indian-born South African business family, is central to the corruption allegations pitted against Zuma. It is alleged that the president gave the family undue access to sensitive state...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.aljazeera.com">Al Jazeera English</source></item><item><title>Secret ballot no confidence vote to decide Jacob Zuma's fate - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/07/africa/jacob-zuma-no-confidence-vote-south-africa/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEERD7DeyK_bPxy-dGyeDqNAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMPrTpgU</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 15:05:33 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/07/africa/jacob-zuma-no-confidence-vote-south-africa/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Secret ballot no confidence vote to decide Jacob Zuma's fate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simpiwe Madau wears his loyalty on his sleeve, strolling down First Avenue in a faded black shirt bearing the message: "I am ANC." And, in a way, he is. Like his father before him, Madau is a mobilizer for South Africa's ruling ANC party here in Alexandra, a wedge of informal settlements, government housing, and dusty industry in north Johannesburg. During elections, he cajoles people on his shack-filled street to vote for the party. On off years, he acts as a kind of informal community liaison.

In the meeting dubbed D-Day by local media, Zuma is expected to finally resign after weeks of pressure to do so. On Sunday, Cyril Ramaphosa, the new leader of the African National Congress (ANC), addressed a rally in Cape Town marking Mandela's release from prison in 1990. His comments were until now, the biggest indication that Zuma was on his way out.

Now it is an example of how the net may finally be tightening around the Guptas and their associates, as well as a sign of Mr Zuma’s waning influence, according to anti-graft campaigners.
