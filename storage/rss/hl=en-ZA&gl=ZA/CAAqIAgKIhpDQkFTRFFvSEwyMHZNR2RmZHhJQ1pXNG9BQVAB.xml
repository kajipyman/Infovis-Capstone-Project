"Crazy Rich Asians" was nominated for best comedy or musical, and Wu was nominated for best performance by an actress in a musical or comedy motion picture.

To honor the 25th anniversary of Steven Spielberg’s masterpiece Schindler’s List, Universal Pictures will re-release the film for a limited theatrical engagement with picture and sound digitally remastered.
