Some cheered the protesters from kilometers-long lines at gas stations that still have fuel. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration is under growing pressure one year after taking office following the removal of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. Tensions remain high after July's disputed election that Mnangagwa narrowly won.

The government says it's paving the way with a new mantra geared towards economic and political reforms.
