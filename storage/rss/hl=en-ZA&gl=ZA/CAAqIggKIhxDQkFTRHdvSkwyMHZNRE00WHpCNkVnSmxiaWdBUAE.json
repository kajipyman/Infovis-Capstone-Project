The touring West Indians - under brand-new captain Rovman Powell - lost their only warm-up game before the three-match ODI series that begins on Saturday in a high-scoring rain-hit contest. Tamim, who fractured his left wrist during the Asia Cup in September, scored at a strike-rate close to 150, as he pummelled the West Indian bowlers for 13 fours and four sixes, making a 73-ball 107 while chasing 332."
