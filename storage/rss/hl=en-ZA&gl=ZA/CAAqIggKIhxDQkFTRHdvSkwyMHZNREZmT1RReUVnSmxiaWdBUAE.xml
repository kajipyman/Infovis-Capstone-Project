That’s the word Christina Jones uses to describe the way she lives. The Arkansas native is a housekeeper at a hospital in the town of Jonesboro, an hour’s drive from Memphis, Tennessee. There, she makes $10 an hour cleaning rooms, changing bed sheets, emptying trash cans. It’s dirty work, and it doesn’t cover all her bills, but Jones says she enjoys it. She is grateful to have the job and smiles so much that her colleagues gave her the nickname “Sunshine.” “If they only knew that yesterday I had to put my last 20 [dollars] in the car [for fuel], and I’m wondering all weekend how I’m...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.voanews.com">VOA News</source></item><item><title>U.S. gains 155,000 jobs, unemployment stays at 3.7% in plain-vanilla November labor report - MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-gains-155000-jobs-in-november-and-unemployment-rate-stays-at-37-2018-12-07</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMEENxb2t98YlpI3el99K5UqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowjujJATDXzBUw2JS0AQ</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:58:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-gains-155000-jobs-in-november-and-unemployment-rate-stays-at-37-2018-12-07" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. gains 155,000 jobs, unemployment stays at 3.7% in plain-vanilla November labor report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECONOMIC REPORT By Jeffry Bartash Yearly increase in U.S. wages remains at nine-year high of 3.1% The U.S. economy has created more than 2 million new jobs in 2018 in health care, construction, manufacturing, hospitality and many other industries.

Here's why.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strike by charter school teachers in Chicago, described as the nation's first, concluded its first week after staff members asked for better wages, less crowded classrooms and decreased work hours. About 500 of teachers and other staff members with the Acero Schools charter network walked off the job, according to CNN affiliate WGN-TV, after a failed contract renegotiation with management by Tuesday's deadline. The network runs 15 privately operated campuses across Chicago, housing 7,500 students. Classes have been canceled as the strike continues.

When retiring overseas, one of the big issues to address is legal residency, the right to be physically present in a country indefinitely. You can avoid having to qualify for legal residency by staying only as long as a tourist is permitted to remain in the country (usually 30 to 90 days). If you want to stay longer or don’t want to have to worry about restrictions on your comings and goings, you’ll need more permanent status.

Private-sector wages were up 3.1% in the third quarter from a year earlier, well ahead of consumer price inflation. Now the salient question is can the Trump economy keep producing those kinds of results? For an extended period, pay adjusted for inflation can’t rise faster than labor productivity, because human resources are the largest component of business costs.

Much the same, if you’re a consumer you’re a worker first; that or you’ve been handed the consumptive fruits of work by some other worker. Work is just demand for goods and services in disguise.
