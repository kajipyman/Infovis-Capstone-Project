            "desc": "Memories of batting with the banned former captain Steven Smith during last summer's Ashes will be at the forefront of Mitchell Marsh's mind. This as he seeks to quieten a vociferous lobby of critics while making the No. 6 berth and the Australian vice-captaincy his own during the Test series against India. It's been a little less than a year since Marsh was recalled to the Australian Test side for the third Test of the home bout with England in Perth. He joined with Smith for a punishing stand worth 301 that not only delivered the allrounder his first Test hundred, but also effectively sea..."

(Photo by Ryan Pierse \u2013 CA/Cricket Australia/Getty Images) Australia and India despise each other. The battles between the two powerhouses have long been contentious and fiery \u2013 even downright spiteful and nasty. In the past decade there has been the infamous \u2018Monkeygate\u2019 scandal, an ugly spat between Virat Kohli and Mitchell Johnson in 2014-15 and Steve Smith\u2019s DRS saga last year. Contests between the two countries have been marred by bickering and petty behavior. Led by firebrand Kohli, India\u2019s current ge..."

There is no doubt it has been an ugly episode for the game and the individuals involved. Footage of high-profile players involved in a fight and the headlines that follow..."
