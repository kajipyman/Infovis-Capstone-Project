Not for the first time. In fact, just three months previously in April in an accident at the same pit, six miners were killed and three injured. In all, 32 miners have died in accidents at the Mindeli mine in Tkibuli, 200 km (124 miles) west of the capital Tbilisi, over the past decade and most local men acknowledge that if they could find other work they would do. The reality is there is no other alternative. July's accident was caused...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>Special Report: Little lab on the prairie clears path to big 'clean coal' profits - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-coal-labs-specialreport/special-report-little-lab-on-the-prairie-clears-path-to-big-clean-coal-profits-idUSKBN1O31Q7</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMnGDigE9DXMatdNo1cSnX4qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMJSCDg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 14:14:52 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-coal-labs-specialreport/special-report-little-lab-on-the-prairie-clears-path-to-big-clean-coal-profits-idUSKBN1O31Q7" target="_blank"&gt;Special Report: Little lab on the prairie clears path to big 'clean coal' profits&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clean” coal is a rich vein for American investors to mine, thanks to a lucrative subsidy offered by the U.S. government. For many producers of the fuel, the path to profit leads through a laboratory at the University of North Dakota. The school’s Energy and Environmental Research Center reported earning about $5 million in fiscal 2015-16 performing laboratory tests that qualify clean-coal producers for the subsidy. On any given day, EERC technicians take a sample of up to one ton of the coal from a producer and burn it in a miniature boiler to determine whether it reduces a specific pollut...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>Special Report: Wall Street cleans up on 'clean' coal subsidies - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-coal-wallstreet-specialreport/special-report-wall-street-cleans-up-on-clean-coal-subsidies-idUSKBN1O31BM</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMmYxk_2YuRYF650TTt323kqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMJSCDg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 12:27:12 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-coal-wallstreet-specialreport/special-report-wall-street-cleans-up-on-clean-coal-subsidies-idUSKBN1O31BM" target="_blank"&gt;Special Report: Wall Street cleans up on 'clean' coal subsidies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the chief financial officer of global insurance giant Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. (AJG.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) explained to analysts how the company had turned a little-known U.S. energy subsidy into a profit machine, worth hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line. The money came from the U.S. “clean coal” tax credit, a provision of the American Jobs Act of 2004 meant to encourage the use of chemically treated coal to cut pollution in the nation’s power plants. To capitalize on the subsidy, A.J.

There is also a fragile hope that a better, cleaner future could follow — but a barely hidden warning that the despair that propelled Trump to power in the U.S. lurks in the wings if it does not. Spain’s uneconomic coal industry has been killed by a pincer movement: cheaper imports from developing countries on one flank and falling renewable energy prices ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>Renewables heading for 80 per cent of electricity market by 2030 - ABC News</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-30/renewables-now-heading-for-80-per-cent-of-electricity-market/10567838</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEKhNL3SY8JBz0eAA2bA2bRcqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDM2g4</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 18:34:59 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-30/renewables-now-heading-for-80-per-cent-of-electricity-market/10567838" target="_blank"&gt;Renewables heading for 80 per cent of electricity market by 2030&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewable generation installation has accelerated to such an extent it is on track to provide almost 80 per cent of the electricity market by 2030, according to research from consultancy Green Energy Markets.

The concentration of carbon in the atmosphere has kept going up. Lots of money has been spent, vested interests have profited, but the reality is that we remain well on course for exceeding 2C warming. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have already breached 400 parts per million and we are on our way to 500. What was agreed at Paris three years ago will not get us anywhere near to the target of limiting man-made temperature increases to 2C, let alone the new 1.5C target.
