The worldwide unemployment rate has dropped from 8 per cent of the workforce in 2010 to 5.2 per cent in September, the lowest level since 5 per cent in 1980, according to an analysis by UBS, the investment bank. The survey encompassed 48 developed and emerging economies, which between them account for 84 per cent of global output. Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labou..."

That's the ridehailing equivalent of a $15 minimum wage, accounting for the fact that those drivers have to pay payroll taxes and do not receive paid time off, the TLC said.
