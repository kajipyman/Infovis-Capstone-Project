It's a major mess and will cost billions to fix - but we have to accept the deal on the table or live with the 'dark-age' consequences of no deal. The issue of broadband infrastructure has been examined as far back as the late 1990s with various governments commissioning reports. They generally reached the obvious conclusions that there was a deficit of broadband in the regions outside of Dublin which affected enterprise development, including foreign direct investment.

What does that mean, 'new fibre broadband lines'? It means they replace your existing phone lines. They're laid right up to your house. They carry a phone signal and a high-speed broadband connection. So the Government is talking about covering all of rural Ireland with this? Most of it, yes. But also parts of urban Ireland, too.
