After graduating from law school three years earlier, he was stuck making monthly payments on $100,000 worth of loans, and wasn’t even beginning to chip away at the principal. But Lakier qualified for a federal student loan forgiveness program. “The plan was, I would wait 20 years and if I made those minimum payments, the rest would be forgiven,” he remembers. His employer at the time, Ernst &amp; Young, had recently begun offering a discount on student loan refinancing as part of its employee benefits package.
