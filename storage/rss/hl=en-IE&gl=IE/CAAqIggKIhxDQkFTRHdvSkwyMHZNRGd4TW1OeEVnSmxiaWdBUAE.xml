Costello criticised pundits who have described Dublin’s players as ‘robots’ or ‘automatons’. The 2018 season saw Dublin once again sweep up a collection of honours as they won the All-Ireland, Leinster and league crowns. “Some of the commentary on our senior footballers and management was eye-catching and I think it would be remiss of me not to let it pass unchallenged,” wrote Dublin secretary ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.the42.ie">The42</source></item><item><title>Throwing barbs and ties: John Costello’s sermon from the mount - Irish Examiner</title><link>https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/gaa/throwing-barbs-and-ties-john-costellos-sermon-from-the-mount-890472.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJQpMC5XpvzQKbvdUUt3SH0qGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyNLTATDN-jUw2pahAQ</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/gaa/throwing-barbs-and-ties-john-costellos-sermon-from-the-mount-890472.html" target="_blank"&gt;Throwing barbs and ties: John Costello’s sermon from the mount&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Irish Examiner&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headlines are no surprise, even if the targets are becoming predictable. Dublin GAA secretary John Costello published his annual report yesterday and, as expected, it was a wide-ranging treatise, a little like the confirmation sermons of Bishop Connie Lucey in Cork long ago, which tended to roam among, and cover, the pressing social issues of the day. Costello’s report, as expected, left stud-marks on the shins of those who begrudge Dublin their dominance of Gaelic football. “Some of the commentary on our senior footballers and management was eye-catching and I think it would be remiss ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.irishexaminer.com">Irish Examiner</source></item><item><title>Con O’Callaghan 'Everyone will be trying to stop you — that’s the reality of it’ - Irish Examiner</title><link>https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/gaa/con-ocallaghan-everyone-will-be-trying-to-stop-you-thats-the-reality-of-it-889646.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEA9_3B1yvaKTN7eGVt9jwhIqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyNLTATDN-jUw2pahAQ</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/gaa/con-ocallaghan-everyone-will-be-trying-to-stop-you-thats-the-reality-of-it-889646.html" target="_blank"&gt;Con O’Callaghan 'Everyone will be trying to stop you — that’s the reality of it’&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Irish Examiner&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Con O’Callaghan knows what he’s missing.

It is July 6, 1991. The third replay of the Leinster Championship match between Meath and Dublin is in injury-time, there are 90 seconds to go, and Meath are trailing by three points, 0-15 to 1-9. The roar from the crowd, transfixed after three epic draws in the previous month, is deafening. David Beggy wins the ball out near the middle of the field on the left touchline. "It's still possible," says Ger Canning, as Beggy handpasses it to Kevin Foley, racing through from wing-back. (Handpass number 1.)

And while there was a school, church and shop there was no centre for Gaelic games, so a group in the parish decided to rectify that - and St Jude's GAA club was born.
