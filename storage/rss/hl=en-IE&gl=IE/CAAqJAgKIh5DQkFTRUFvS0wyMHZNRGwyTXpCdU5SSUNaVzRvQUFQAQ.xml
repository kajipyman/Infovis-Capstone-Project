Bennis was drafted in during the 2006 championship in a caretaker manager capacity following Joe McKenna’s resignation. It was Hickey’s first season with the seniors having lined out for the county in a minor All-Ireland final three years earlier, and for Bennis, he ticked all the boxes.

There are more arguments against the O'Byrne Cups and all the other pre-season competitions than there are for, but they're going ahead again and that's not going to change now. Because from Longford to Laois, from Carlow to Offaly, there are county games taking place in what will be windy and water covered GAA grounds all over the country. Do we really need them?

A drop of 9pc in sanctions to New York, North America and Canadian divisions was recorded, from 695 down to 631, rebuffing the perception that more players went abroad to play football because of the calendar changes. By comparison to 2015 there was a 12pc drop, when 719 sanctions were sought. The report suggests that the numbers travelling with sanctions are just 1pc of the overall playing body.

The next meaningful inter-county GAA match, a Division 1 tie between Mayo and Roscommon, is scheduled for Saturday, January 26, 2019 – 17 weeks from today. As I have repeatedly written on these pages, I think it’s absolute madness on the part ofthe GAA to take its top products – inter-county football and hurling – out of the shop window, allowing their rivals a clear field for five months. Just to compound the issue,there is no inter-county activity planned ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.ie">Independent.ie</source></item><item><title>New study finds players are spending up to 31 hours per week on inter-county commitments - The42</title><link>http://www.the42.ie/ersi-inter-county-study-commitments-4241267-Sep2018/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEN2p1jMrSTZpoEuP-BbZ7JUqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowgOufCTCbyG8wwM2hAQ</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 10:56:50 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.the42.ie/ersi-inter-county-study-commitments-4241267-Sep2018/" target="_blank"&gt;New study finds players are spending up to 31 hours per week on inter-county commitments&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The42&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NEW ERSI study has shed some light on the demands of being an inter-county player, with information on the time commitment involved, compromised sleep and injuries some of its major findings.

GAA players can spend up to 31 hours in the week on their commitment to senior inter-county activity On average during the 2016 championship, players allocated just over six hours on a week-day pitch-based training day to their inter-county commitments.

A study was carried out on the lives of inter-county players recently and there were some interesting findings. Basically, inter-county players are more sleep-deprived and injury prone than your normal Gael because of their involvement in the county panel. But as with all stats, they should be taken with a pinch of salt. The deficit in sleep is hardly surprising given the hectic lives inter-county players lead, but we'd doubt that club players are getting much more sleep than them.
