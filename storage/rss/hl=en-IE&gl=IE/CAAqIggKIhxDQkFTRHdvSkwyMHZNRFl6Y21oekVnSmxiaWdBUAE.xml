A team of contractors on Monday started combing an acre of Braggan bog, near Emyvale in County Monaghan, in the Republic of Ireland. The bog is believed to hold the body of Columba McVeigh, who was 19 when the IRA killed him on suspicion of working as an informer for the security forces at the height of the Troubles. He was one of 16 people known as “the disappeared” who vanished after being abducted, mainly by IRA intern...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>RUC told to put intelligence before arrests, reveals secret MI5 report - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/special-branch-ruc-put-evidence-before-arrest-walker-mi5-report-northern-ireland</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEIjeLv0NZNC4FQ4BiSyJQoQqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDJ4PsF</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2018 10:28:21 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/26/special-branch-ruc-put-evidence-before-arrest-walker-mi5-report-northern-ireland" target="_blank"&gt;RUC told to put intelligence before arrests, reveals secret MI5 report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secret MI5 report that resulted in Northern Ireland’s police covertly prioritising intelligence-gathering over fighting crime has been made public after almost 40 years. The report resulted in detectives of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) – now the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) – being ordered never to arrest a suspected terrorist without consulting the force’s intelligence-gathering section. Detectives were also told that anyone who was arrested could be recruited as an agent rather than charged with a criminal offence.

He was wearing an ill-fitting grey suit and a grey tie; his hair was grey, and so too were his handcuffs. The only flash of colour came from his florid and slightly sagging face. In the public gallery, 10 feet behind the dock, a handful of people sat and stared at the back of the man’s red neck. Outside, 30 armed police officers were standing guard.
