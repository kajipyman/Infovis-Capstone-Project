Dr Ken Egan, chairman of the National Association of GP Co-ops, said a woman seeking an abortion would not be classified as an emergency which is the service out-of-hours doctors provide.

For some, the intervention seemed tone deaf, while for others it was simply a blunt assessment of the referendum result. Pro-life TDs who had made repeated bids to dramatically change the abortion legislation had accused people of making personal attacks or ignoring the views of the voters who had voted No last May.

So, how can this be legal given the fact that the landmark ruling in the court case of Roe v Wade from 1973, which gave American women the legal right to an abortion, has not been overturned? The world ends not with a bang but with a whimper - to paraphrase American poet TS Eliot.

Baby Angel Ikhena was born prematurely at 24 weeks on March 4 2017 and died two days later. The cause of death was complications due to extreme prematurity but the cause of prematurity was not known. Dublin Coroner’s Court heard conflicting evidence from the parents of Baby Angel, who were sharing a flat on Bridge Street in Dundalk.
