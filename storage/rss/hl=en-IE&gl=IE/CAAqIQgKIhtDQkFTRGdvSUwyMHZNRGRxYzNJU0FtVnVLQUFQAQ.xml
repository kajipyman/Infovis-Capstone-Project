Mr. Shelley’s breakneck guitar strumming propelled songs that often proclaimed lovelorn vulnerability alongside acute self-consciousness. “I’m in distress, I need a caress,” he sang on one of the first Buzzcocks singles, “What Do I Get?” Buzzcocks, formed in 1976, were in Londo...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Pete Shelley wasn’t just a genius, he was a relief from the machismo of punk - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/07/pete-shelley-genius-1970s-punk-buzzcocks-frontman</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEB3_zYkq1Sve8iDUaCt1v0wqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTC9vBU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:12:08 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/07/pete-shelley-genius-1970s-punk-buzzcocks-frontman" target="_blank"&gt;Pete Shelley wasn’t just a genius, he was a relief from the machismo of punk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the words, isn’t it?

Pete Shelley was studying philosophy and comparative literature when he got swept up into a band, then became frontman. How could he not have been? Look at that face in those early clips.

As Hull band Life demonstrate deftly with their debut album – the dryly titled Popular Music – that’s because it is difficult to avoid sounding incredibly dated with it. At times, you get the impression their retro stylings could be deliberate – on Euromillions, echoes of the Clash’s Know Your Rights are too loud to ignore – but generally the critiques of consumerism and anonymous society feel generic and vague.

Now they’re in a case in an art gallery, and Linder herself is a famous artist. Yet the way she has staged her retrospective at Nottingham Contemporary proves that punk’s not dead – not in her imagination anyway. Linder doesn’t want to be an art star. Imagine that line set to one-note guitar and thudding drums. She doesn’t wanna be a cultural totem. Instead of an exhibition about herself, she has stag...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Mark E Smith obituary: the Fall's driving force was poet, satirist and misanthrope - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-obituary</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPxOVvtl5Pwff4-Mu-O5q6EqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTCOvRU</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 21:24:04 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-obituary" target="_blank"&gt;Mark E Smith obituary: the Fall's driving force was poet, satirist and misanthrope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the fascinating musical offshoots that sprang from mid-70s punk rock, the Fall proved the strangest and most durable. The group was a vehicle for the singer and lyricist Mark E Smith, who has died aged 60 after an extended period of ill health, including respiratory problems. He formed the Fall after seeing the Sex Pistols perform their famous concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, Manchester, in June 1976. This became dubbed “the gig that changed the world”, because, as well as Smith, it was witnessed by future members of Joy Division, the Smiths and Buzzcocks, who all left with a b...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Inhumane resources: how not to sack your employees - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2017/nov/01/inhumane-resources-how-not-to-sack-your-employees</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiECh7iyb0_8sEeK21X678aO8qFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDlkko</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:22:15 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2017/nov/01/inhumane-resources-how-not-to-sack-your-employees" target="_blank"&gt;Inhumane resources: how not to sack your employees&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have all dreamed of sending the boss the big flip-off email, the final flounce-out, a few choice putdowns, a trenchant structural analysis of the company’s medium-term flaws, a colossally ironic final wishing of good luck. But what if you are the boss? If you are Somerset bus company director Sydney Hardy, it turns out you do it anyway. On Sunday, Hardy sent an email to his 27 Nippybus drivers informing them that the company would be wound up and so not to bother turning up: “I am quitting to pursue my dream of not having to work here.” “There is a difference between giving up and knowin...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Remembering Sean Hughes: ‘The sadness is he didn’t get to be old, just lonely’ - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/oct/19/remembering-sean-hughes-the-sadness-is-he-didnt-get-to-be-old-just-lonely</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJoMMkSRdJj-PAXez5feYDwqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTCOvRU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2017 05:00:14 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/oct/19/remembering-sean-hughes-the-sadness-is-he-didnt-get-to-be-old-just-lonely" target="_blank"&gt;Remembering Sean Hughes: ‘The sadness is he didn’t get to be old, just lonely’&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Donnelly was driving on Monday morning when his phone rang. He could not pick up, but when he saw who had called – someone who was friends with him and Sean Hughes – he guessed what was coming. He called back and learned that Hughes, just 51 years old, had been picked up from his home by an ambulance on Sunday night. On the way to hospital he went into cardiac arrest. He died shortly afterwards. It transpired that he was also suffering from cirrhosis of the liver.

Until his 1990 Edinburgh festival fringe show, A One Night Stand With Sean Hughes, won the Perrier award for best show, most alternative comedy shows at the fringe were little more than extended comedy club sets, gags shamelessly stitched together. Hughes did something different, weaving a narrative into his performance, which was set in an imaginary bedsit. Today we think nothing of comedy shows having an emotional arc regarding some personal grief or loss.
