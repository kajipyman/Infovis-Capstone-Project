Police said Cardi B and her entourage were at the club around 3 a.m. when she argued with a 23-year-old bartender.

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper, whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar, sported long rainbow hair (a la Tekshi 6ix9ine’s dye job), a black fur-collared jacket, and Louboutin booties. She had crystal-encrusted nails that sparkled with each minuscule hand movement.
