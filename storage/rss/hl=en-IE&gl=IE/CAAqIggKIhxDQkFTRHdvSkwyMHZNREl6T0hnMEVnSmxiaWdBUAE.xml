A majority of four justices ruled that elections won on religious- or caste-based appeals by candidates or their proxies could be declared null and void.

Three out of the five judges on the constitution bench ruled against the "triple talaq" law, which allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word "talaq" three times.

The prime minister leads a Hindu nationalist party and has been accused of stoking hatred and violence against Muslims. But last week, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that political appeals on the basis of religion, caste, community or language, violate the Indian Constitution's guarantee of fundamentally secular elections. Elections could be voided if the rule is violated. But will the ruling create greater equality or undermine Indian democracy?
