The weeks-long public spat between Alok Verma, director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and his second-in-command, Rakesh Asthana, has embarrassed an agency that serves a similar role as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. The CBI is leading several high profile investigations such as the $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank involving fugitive diamond billionaire Nirav Modi, a...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>India's CBI chief removed, critics say 'misuse of power' - Al Jazeera English</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/india-cbi-chief-removed-critics-misuse-power-181024085438865.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEYg_XZaBL5Kdy2vezpULfsqFAgEKgwIACoFCAowhgIwkDgw0O8B</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 14:58:41 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/india-cbi-chief-removed-critics-misuse-power-181024085438865.html" target="_blank"&gt;India's CBI chief removed, critics say 'misuse of power'&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Al Jazeera English&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's government removed the head of the country's top investigating agency and his deputy in a pre-dawn raid on Wednesday - a move the opposition parties and constitutional experts said amounted to "misuse of power". Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Alok Verma, and Special Director Rakesh Asthana were asked to go on leave after the premier agency filed a corruption case against Asthana.
