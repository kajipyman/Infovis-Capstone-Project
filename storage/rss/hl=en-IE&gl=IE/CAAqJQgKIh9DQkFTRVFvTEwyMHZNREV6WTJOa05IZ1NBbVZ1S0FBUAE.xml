The warning from Carolyn McCall, chief executive of the UK’s largest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, follows protracted talks between the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV to create a credible domestic streaming rival to Netflix that have failed to bear fruit. McCall, who took over at ITV in January, has made developing a subscription video-on-demand service a priority – to sit alongside existing free service ITV Hub and a paid-f...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Love Island's Rosie confirms new relationship with series of romantic posts - Her.ie</title><link>https://www.her.ie/entertainment/love-islands-rosie-confirms-new-relationship-series-romantic-posts-430794</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEj_BltT9MK0-xyBHic7ZF0qGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyN-fCTD7um8w6a6hAQ</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 12:27:19 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.her.ie/entertainment/love-islands-rosie-confirms-new-relationship-series-romantic-posts-430794" target="_blank"&gt;Love Island's Rosie confirms new relationship with series of romantic posts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Her.ie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Love Island favourite has found love after the villa. Rosie Williams didnt have the easiest of times in the Love Island villa. The solicitor found herself wrapped up in one of the most drama-filled relationships on the show when she partnered with Adam after entering the villa. Yes, the pair were trouble from the very beginning with Rosie eventually going home broken-hearted after Adam left her for Zara. However, things seem to have worked out for the better as Adam and Zara are still loved up and now it looks like Rosie is too.

We've been hoping and praying for these two to pair up together for a project and now, finally, we're getting what we asked for! After finding out that their "Kardashian-esque" TV show was actually going to be less Kardashian-esque and more just based on Dani and Jack, it did make us shed a tear as we prayed the Eastenders star would be on the big screen alongside his daughter.

Laura and Paul broke up last month and at the time, their busy schedules were reportedly the reason for the split. Paul had been on holidays in America, Laura in Dubai and they had various work commitments as a result of the reality TV show too.
