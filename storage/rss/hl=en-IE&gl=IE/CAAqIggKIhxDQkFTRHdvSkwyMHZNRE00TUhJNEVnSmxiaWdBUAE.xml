Twenty-one days ago, the clock had stopped at 61:21 when Devin Toner ran across the pitch to the sound of more than 50,000 fans applauding him off in Ireland's game with New Zealand. There was still 20 minutes left to play but this ovation was an acknowledgement of how he had played, irrespective of the result.

People take painkillers in everyday walks of life, so on one hand should it really come as that much of a shock that rugby players do so too in what is an increasingly combative sport? There is, however, a fine line between taking medication and abusing or becoming overly reliant on it.

The Irish Rugby Football Union confirmed on Monday that Schmidt would step down after Japan 2019, with Farrell, the defence coach who previously held the same role for England, taking over the main job. Farrell’s appointment is not unexpected.

Brian O’Driscoll and Tana Umaga sitting at the top of a round table discussion in Dublin on the week of Ireland’s first-versus-second, Grand Slam champions versus Rugby Championship winners showdown with the All the Blacks. They’re best mates, now. Sharing a joke, having a laugh. Third question in. What about ‘the tackle’ in 2005? And then Umaga, the former All Black centre turned Auckland Bl...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.the42.ie">The42</source></item></channel></rss>
