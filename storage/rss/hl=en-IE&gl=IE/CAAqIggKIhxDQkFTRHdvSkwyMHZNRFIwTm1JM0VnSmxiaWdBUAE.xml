According to French Lyon newspaper Le Progrés, Jackson is lined up as a possible replacement for Lionel Beauxis who will leave Lyon at the end of the season. A clause in Jackson's contract allows him to move on if his team are relegated from the Top 14, the report claims. They currently lie at the foot of the table and are nine points adrift of 13th-placed Agen. Last March, jury found Jackson (26) and fellow Ulster and Ireland player Stuart Olding (25) unanimously not guilty of rape.

And yet it was immediately clear that nobody was going anywhere in a hurry. From wall to wall, the tiny terminal building heaved with humanity and shook with song; a weary squad shuffled through the throng overjoyed Dragons fans, raising the Challenge Cup to the heavens as if presenting it for approval. This was not the first time the Challenge Cup had seen French soil. It had occasionally been flown to Perpignan on promotional tour...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Ronan O’Gara tips Paulie to pass coaching test in Paris - Irish Examiner</title><link>https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/rugby/ronan-ogara-tips-paulie-to-pass-coaching-test-in-paris-864460.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEBFtje1d_lFFceAdXhp9GGsqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyNLTATDN-jUw2pahAQ</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Aug 2018 07:26:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/rugby/ronan-ogara-tips-paulie-to-pass-coaching-test-in-paris-864460.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ronan O’Gara tips Paulie to pass coaching test in Paris&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Irish Examiner&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronan O’Gara believes former Munster and Ireland team-mate Paul O’Connell is testing the water for a career in coaching with his first full-time job as a forwards coach at Stade Francais. The French Top 14 campaign begins today with O’Connell’s new Parisian club away at Paddy Jackson’s newly-promoted Perpignan, the 38-year-old former Ireland skipper having joined head coach Heyneke Meyer and a backroom team also including fellow Munsterman Mike Prendergast as backs coach.

The victory over seven-time winners and favourites Warrington Wolves made them the first French winners as well as the first non-English champions in the competition’s history. Coached by former England coach Steve McNamara, Dragons were the better team for the first 55 minutes, maintaining good discipline and high tempo while undermining Warrington’s composure.

After 80 minutes of guts and grit and almost unimaginable tension, the release: the victorious Catalans Dragons players charging towards their little pocket of fans at Wembley Stadium’s northern end, the few who could afford to make the trip. This was the 117th Challenge Cup final, and until now all 116 of them had been won by an English team. Until now.

French rugby players don't get much of a break at all. Six weeks after the French national side finished up their three-Test tour of New Zealand, the country's Top 14 and Pro D2 sides were back out in pre-season matches. Forget this 11-month season talk. In France, it's about 363 days of the year.

Jackson, who played the opening half of their pre-season clash with Toulouse at Stade Aime Giral before Perpignan changed their entire team at the interval, showed few signs of being out of action since winning his 25th cap for Ireland against Japan in June last year. The 26-year old was handed a difficult opening conversion after eight minutes when Australian Zack Holmes scored in the right corner but Jackson landed the kick and grew in confidence after that. ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.ie">Independent.ie</source></item><item><title>Paddy Jackson set for first rugby match since June 2017 as he prepares for Thursday debut with Perpignan - Independent.ie</title><link>https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/other-rugby/paddy-jackson-set-for-first-rugby-match-since-june-2017-as-he-prepares-for-thursday-debut-with-perpignan-37197572.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEN7AHCPogsU-Y_3DKYOb6OYqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowseyfCTDMyG8w_8yiAQ</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018 19:00:30 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/other-rugby/paddy-jackson-set-for-first-rugby-match-since-june-2017-as-he-prepares-for-thursday-debut-with-perpignan-37197572.html" target="_blank"&gt;Paddy Jackson set for first rugby match since June 2017 as he prepares for Thursday debut with Perpignan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Independent.ie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Ireland and Ulster out-half Paddy Jackson will play his first professional rugby match in over a year tomorrow as Perpignan begin their pre-season schedule with a game against Toulouse.
