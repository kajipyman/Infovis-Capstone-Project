It's a major mess and will cost billions to fix - but we have to accept the deal on the table or live with the 'dark-age' consequences of no deal. The issue of broadband infrastructure has been examined as far back as the late 1990s with various governments commissioning reports. They generally reached the obvious conclusions that there was a deficit of broadband in the regions outside of Dublin which affected enterprise development, including foreign direct investment. However, filling that gap in the market wouldn't be straight-forward.

What is the National Broadband Plan (NBP)? A. It's a Government scheme to invest over €1bn in laying new fibre broadband lines to large chunks of the country that ordinary broadband operators won't serve. What does that mean, 'new fibre broadband lines'? It means they replace your existing phone lines. They're laid right up to your house. They carry a phone signal and a high-speed broadband connection. So the Government is talking about covering all of rural Ireland with this? Most of it, yes. But also parts of urban Ireland, too.

That’s because the saga has had more ups and downs than an unreliable internet connection in rural west Kerry. What is the National Broadband Plan? The National Broadband Plan has been in the works since 2012 and was described at the time it was announced as being akin to the "rural electrification of the 21st century". Its aim is to bring high-speed broadband to every home and business in the country where such a service is not currently available, because c...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rte.ie">RTÉ News</source></item><item><title>Opposition: Broadband bid review a whitewash - Irish Examiner</title><link>https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/opposition-broadband-bid-review-a-whitewash-888396.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiECTfURGoFe36T5jUUh3zKVQqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyNLTATDN-jUwjbOhAQ</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:20:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/opposition-broadband-bid-review-a-whitewash-888396.html" target="_blank"&gt;Opposition: Broadband bid review a whitewash&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Irish Examiner&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Fiachra Ó Cionnaith, Daniel McConnell, and Juno McEnroe The Government-backed investigation into the Denis Naughten broadband lobbying crisis has been labelled a whitewash after it cleared him of wrongdoing despite having to “rely” on his own word to draw the conclusion. Opposition parties demanded a special Dáil debate next Tuesday after the review said Mr Naughten’s repeated meetings with the only bidder still seeking the €3bn broadband plan tender did not influence the procurement process.
