Davis enjoyed a 12 year inter-county career between 1995 and 2007, winning four Longford Senior Football Championships with Fr Manning Gaels. The 42-year-old went into management following the end of his playing career, helping St. Vincent’s to a minor football championship, while also helping the Longford U21s to the 2011 Leinster final. “The subcommittee tasked with seeking a new Longford Senior Football Manager have today c...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.the42.ie">The42</source></item><item><title>Davis set to take over as new Longford manager - RTÉ News</title><link>https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2018/0901/990943-davis-set-to-take-over-as-new-longford-manager/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEAr55kp_qd2ke6Zw9LgbTWIqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyOSfCTDbw28w-6qhAQ</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 16:41:10 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2018/0901/990943-davis-set-to-take-over-as-new-longford-manager/" target="_blank"&gt;Davis set to take over as new Longford manager&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;RTÉ News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Padraic Davis has been proposed as the new Longford senior football manager by the selection committee charged with finding a successor to Denis Connerton, the county said on Saturday. Davis, who was one of the county's leading forwards in the nineties and noughties, and a selector during Glenn Ryan's term, arrives in the job with strong credentials, having guided Mohill to two Leitrim county titles in the last three years. The subcommittee tasked with seeking a new Longford Senior Football Manager have today completed the process and will be proposing the name of Padraic Davis for ratifica...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rte.ie">RTÉ News</source></item><item><title>Fenn hails McGlade’s Longford progress - Independent.ie</title><link>https://www.independent.ie/sport/fenn-hails-mcglades-longford-progress-37255082.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPErfT603abKSuh-DwCVg8UqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowseyfCTDMyG8w_8yiAQ</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/fenn-hails-mcglades-longford-progress-37255082.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fenn hails McGlade’s Longford progress&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Independent.ie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dylan McGlade is delighting Longford Town manager Neale Fenn by delivering on his promise. Shelbourne had no answer to McGlade’s wing wizardry on Saturday as Longford booked their place in tonight’s draw for the FAI Cup quarter-finals. After their goalkeeper Michael Kelly made a big save from Lorcan Fitzgerald, Longford took the lead in first-half added time. Captain Dean Zambra’s sublime through-ball found the run of McGlade, who was tripped by Reece McEnteer, and McGlade stepped up to confidently send Dean Delany the wrong way from the penalty spot. Darren Meenan hit an upright on 65 minu...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.ie">Independent.ie</source></item><item><title>Quaid linked with Westmeath job after Kildare exit - Independent.ie</title><link>https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/quaid-linked-with-westmeath-job-after-kildare-exit-37265690.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELZYPATiJPtFim2W9vXUyZAqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowseyfCTDMyG8w_8yiAQ</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2018 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/quaid-linked-with-westmeath-job-after-kildare-exit-37265690.html" target="_blank"&gt;Quaid linked with Westmeath job after Kildare exit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Independent.ie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The managerial merry-go-round is in full swing with a host of inter-county hot seats to be filled and it looks like former Limerick goalkeeper Joe Quaid will be the next Westmeath hurling manager. Quaid resigned as Kildare boss yesterday having helped the Lilies to Christy Ring Cup glory this summer in his third year at the helm and it looks like he is set to switch to Westmeath and edge out Johnny Greville to take the post. Michael Ryan departed following their All-Ireland SHC preliminary quarter-final defeat to Wexford and if Quaid takes the job as expected, he will hope to go one better ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.ie">Independent.ie</source></item></channel></rss>
