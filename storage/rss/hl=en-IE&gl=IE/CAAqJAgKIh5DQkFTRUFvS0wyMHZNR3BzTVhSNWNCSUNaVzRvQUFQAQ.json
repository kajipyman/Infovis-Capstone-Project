The Ireland internationals made their first starts for Munster this season after overcoming respective neck and knee injuries and it didn't take them long to get going again as they both played pivotal parts in dismantling a weakened Edinburgh side. Murray wasted no time in setting the pace for Munster and his box kicks were a welcomed addition as he was able to find touch a number of times for his side early in the first-half. However, while he is renowned for his box kicks from the..."
