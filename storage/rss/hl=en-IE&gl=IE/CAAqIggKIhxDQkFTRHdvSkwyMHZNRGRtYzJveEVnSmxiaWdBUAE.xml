The This Morning presenter is standing in for Donnelly’s long-time co-host Ant McPartlin as he takes a continued break from his TV commitments. She was jokingly introduced to viewers by Donnelly, who said: “Good morning, good evening, and welcome to Australia where the more eagle-eyed viewers among you would have already noticed a big change to this year’s show, yes, one of the most gorgeous presenters on British telev...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.ie">Independent.ie</source></item><item><title>This is what Phillip Schofield had to say about Holly's debut on I'm A Celeb - Her.ie</title><link>https://www.her.ie/entertainment/phillip-schofield-say-hollys-debut-im-celeb-436758</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEBAcrzguQArGOb6RiwpR-IIqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowyN-fCTD7um8w6a6hAQ</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 12:01:17 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.her.ie/entertainment/phillip-schofield-say-hollys-debut-im-celeb-436758" target="_blank"&gt;This is what Phillip Schofield had to say about Holly's debut on I'm A Celeb&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Her.ie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;She made her first appearance last night.

Public opinion on the new presenting duo seemed to be fairly split - one half praising Holly for stepping into Ant's shoes and making it her own, and others criticisingthe star for being 'stiff'.

The Inbetweeners star was the first of this year’s campers to tackle one of the gruelling trials. In Monday night’s instalment of the ITV show, she had to brave a Viper Pit filled with a variety of pythons and rummage for stars – which represented food for the hungry campers. Atack was shaking as she moved through different chambers in the pit, as hosts Declan Donnelly and Holly Willoughby looked on in horror.

Yes, it's no secret that we adore pretty much everything Holly wears on This Morning and beyond, but her looks down under haven't left us with the same need to purchase the piece - until last night. Holly stepped out for the latest episode of I'm A Celeb in a stunning red zebra print dress that has us scrambling to her Instagram to find out where it was from.

The other conspicuous absence was TV gnome Noel Edmonds, widely touted as a contestant this year but not featured in the first episode. Very much in situ, though, was the absent Anthony McPartlin’s temporary replacement, Holly Willoughby. The This Morning presenter seemed subdued as the curtain rose. First night jitters also emanated from Declan Donnelly, visibly trying too hard to create a spark with his new foil.

Fans watching I'm a Celeb were left laughing out LOUD last night when Holly Willoughby made a joke about Dec. Holly took the absolute piss out of her co-stars height (or lack of it). During a gas intro to the show, Holly said to camera: "I'll be meeting a man who saves hundreds of pounds a year by wearing children's clothes." And we are SCREAMING. Dec replied, saying: "Stop, stop, stop! that was a private conversation." The conversation went on, as the duo discussed the contestants on this years show.
