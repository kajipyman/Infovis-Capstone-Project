It was all about respect and making real abusers pay a price for their behavior. But is it possible to have too much of a good thing? One of the aims of the movement was to force a change in the conduct of men who said and did sexually inappropriate things in the workplace — a concept which few people could quibble with. A year on from its beginnings, however, it seems the movement has morphed into something else entirely — and ironically, it’s hurting both men and women.
