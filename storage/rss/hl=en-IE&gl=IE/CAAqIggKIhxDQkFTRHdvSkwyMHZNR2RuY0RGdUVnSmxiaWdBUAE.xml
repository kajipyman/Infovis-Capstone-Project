Capping a swift and dramatic fallout, Hart wrote on Twitter just after midnight Thursday that he was withdrawing as Oscars host because he didn't want to be a distraction. "I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past," wrote Hart.

The comedian Kevin Hart has stepped down as the host following homophobic tweets from 2011 being unearthed. In a tweet, he said: “I sincerely apologise to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past. I’m sorry that I hurt people… I am evolving and want to continue to do so.

And they need to explain why they didn't see this Kevin Hart controversy coming a mile away. His old tweets and stand-up routines were in plain view all along. Hart said Thursday night that he was stepping down as host of the Oscars just two days after he took to Instagram to announce that he got getting the job.
