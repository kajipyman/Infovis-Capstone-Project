For example, you have to learn how to study effectively, how to take good notes in lectures, and how to think critically about what you hear and read. But the biggest challenge you face is how to manage your own learning, a task that involves planning, conducting and evaluating your academic work - thinking for yourself. To overcome this challenge, you have to become a driver (active learner) rather than a passenger.
