He was chief marketing officer for Healthcare.gov, not chief managing officer. More than halfway through the sign-up period for Obamacare health plans, fewer people have enrolled in coverage than during the same stretch last year.

Health spending in the United States totaled $3.5 trillion last year, up 3.9 percent from 2016, or about $10,740 a person. It accounted for 17.9 percent of the economy, officials said. But the rate of increase for the major categories — drugs, doctors and hospitals — was more modest than in recent years.

This created a problem when the borrowing spouse died first and the loan balance became due. Without sufficient liquidity or the ability to refinance, the nonborrowing spouse could be forced out of the home. For more information, download our Reverse Mortgage 101 Cheatsheet.
