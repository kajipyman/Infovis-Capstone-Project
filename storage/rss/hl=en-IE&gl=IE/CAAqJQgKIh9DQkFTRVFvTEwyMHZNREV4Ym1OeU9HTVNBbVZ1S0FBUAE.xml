The worst riots in Paris in decades were sparked by higher fuel taxes, and French President Emmanuel Macron responded by scrapping them Wednesday. But taxes on fossil fuels are just what international climate negotiators, meeting in Poland this week, say are desperately needed to help wean the world off of fossil fuels and slow climate change. “The events of the last few days in Paris have made me regard the challenges as even greater than I thought earlier,” said Stanford University environmental economist Lawrence Goulder,...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.voanews.com">VOA News</source></item><item><title>How China Played Its Trump Card At The G20 Summit And Gained The Upper Hand In Trade War - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/markrosenberg/2018/12/04/how-china-played-its-trump-card-at-the-g20-summit-and-gained-the-upper-hand-in-trade-war/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEDheRYwT_WVcFMiBGETfx6UqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:48:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markrosenberg/2018/12/04/how-china-played-its-trump-card-at-the-g20-summit-and-gained-the-upper-hand-in-trade-war/" target="_blank"&gt;How China Played Its Trump Card At The G20 Summit And Gained The Upper Hand In Trade War&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;US-China trade dispute set to re-escalate Despite the positive atmospherics, our data continues to indicate that the bilateral meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi at this past weekend’s G20 summit did not — and more importantly, will not — result in a major breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade dispute.
