The Dhammakaya Temple has said the monk, 72, is too sick to face questioning and has not been seen for months.

Wirapol Sukphol became infamous when he appeared in a 2013 YouTube video in his monk's robe aboard a private jet, wearing aviator sunglasses with a Louis Vuitton bag by his side. He was defrocked amid accusations he had sexual relations with women â a major violation of the precepts guiding monks' behaviour â and had impregnated one. He fled to the US, where he was arrested in 2016 and extradited last year. - Read more Dalai Lama says...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Buddhist extremism: Meet the violent followers of a religion widely known for its pacifism - ABC News</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-21/buddhist-extremism-meet-the-religions-violent-followers/10360288</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELMVx9Eh1QZP2a1OuyMgsQIqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDciw4</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 19:01:57 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-21/buddhist-extremism-meet-the-religions-violent-followers/10360288" target="_blank"&gt;Buddhist extremism: Meet the violent followers of a religion widely known for its pacifism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Holly Robertson Myanmar's "Buddhist Bin Laden" has made a return to public life, appearing at a rally in support of the military generals condemned globally for a brutal crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya. Wirathu, an infamous Buddhist nationalist monk, was sanctioned in March 2017 for religious hate speech that demonised the Rohingya Muslims. And last weekend, his rhetoric demonstrated that â at least in his mind â little had changed. As military flag-waving demonstrators carried portraits of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Wirathu lambasted the United Nations, saying the day Mya...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item><item><title>Jailed Thai ex-monk gets further 16 years for child rape, abduction - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-religion/jailed-thai-ex-monk-gets-further-16-years-for-child-rape-abduction-idUSKCN1MR0SA</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEImOJ07uF5otZAFyhGY3Ee4qFggEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMLT5lwM</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:16:52 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-religion/jailed-thai-ex-monk-gets-further-16-years-for-child-rape-abduction-idUSKCN1MR0SA" target="_blank"&gt;Jailed Thai ex-monk gets further 16 years for child rape, abduction&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Buddhist monk who sparked outrage in Thailand over his lavish lifestyle and is already serving time for fraud was sentenced to a further 16 years in prison on Wednesday for abducting and raping a child. Wirapol Sukphol, formerly known by his monastic name of Luang Pu Nenkham, was sentenced in August to 114 years in prison after a court found him guilty of fraud, money laundering and computer crimes. He will only serve 20 years on those charges because that is the maximum for someone found guilty of multiple counts of the same offense.
