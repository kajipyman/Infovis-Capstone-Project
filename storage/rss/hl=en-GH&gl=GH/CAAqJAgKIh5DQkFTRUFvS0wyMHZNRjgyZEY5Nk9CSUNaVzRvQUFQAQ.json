            "desc": "Croatia is suffering a severe labor shortage, most glaringly in its booming seaside tourist resorts, that is compounding obstacles to economic growth and dimming hopes of catching up to more developed European Union peers. The problem reflects poor levels of pay, education and skills-training in a still mainly state-dominated economy that has driven many young Croats to find more lucrative, fulfilling work in affluent western EU countries, analysts say. \"The mismatch between education and the needs of the economy, a low readiness for mobility within Croatia and a high number of people leavi..."

In an explanatory note published on Thursday the Department for Exiting the EU said it would continue the existing settlement scheme for EU citizens living in the UK, but make it less generous compared to what is spelled out in the withdrawal agreement. Campaigners said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that ordinary citizens would end up paying the price for the failure of politicians to reach a good deal. They are calling for the EU ..."
