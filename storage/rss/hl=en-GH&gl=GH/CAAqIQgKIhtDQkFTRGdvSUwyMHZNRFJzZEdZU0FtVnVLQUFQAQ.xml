Liverpool have won five of these sides' six league meetings but two years ago Eddie Howe's side fought back from 3-1 down with 14 minutes to play to win a thriller 4-3 at the Vitality Stadium, which will always be known as Dean Court to people of a certain age and sensible disposititions.

The fact that Jurgen Klopp’s side have always been under such pressure to follow the champions with a win, to keep the gap at just two points, has been one big reason why it has felt they have been just about “hanging on” – despite having already been responsible for the seventh best record after 15 games in English history.
