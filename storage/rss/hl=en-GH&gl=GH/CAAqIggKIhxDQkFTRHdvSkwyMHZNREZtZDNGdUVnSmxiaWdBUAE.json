            "desc": "Tottenham and Arsenal have been handed FA Cup third-round trips to lower league opposition, possibly non-League opposition. Spurs, who lost Sunday\u2019s Premier League derby at the Emirates Stadium 4-2, will travel to League Two Tranmere or Southport of the National League North. The Gunners, too, are on the road, to the winners of the second-round replay between National League Solihull Moors and League One Blackpool. Wrexham of the National League will also host Premier League opposition in the shape of the 2016 champions, Leicester City, if they can get past League Two Newport. And Watford l..."

Down to 10 men, Huddersfield conceded an equaliser to Shane Duffy, after Mathias Jorgensen had claimed the fastest goal of the Premier League season to date for them, after 54 seconds. And in the 70th minute, Solly March curled in a superbly-judged left-foot cross and Andone timed his run just as well, arriving ahead of his marker to convert a diving header from six yards. Spanish defender Bruno was influentia..."

The Elland Road captain limped off after damaging a knee midway through the first-half of a largely dour Yorkshire derby which failed to live up to its lofty pre-match billing, and was settled by an error from Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson. Substitute Aapo Halme, the towering Finland Under-21 international who looks a real prospect, stood in manfully in a sterling rearguard as the visitors won at Bramall Lane for the first time in 26 yea..."
