Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota struck in four second half minutes to stun the visitors who now sit 10 points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City. Ruben Loftus-Cheek's deflected opener had put the visitors in control before they slipped to a second straight away defeat after gifting Wolves a way back. Chelsea, who sit fourth, host leaders City on Saturday and Sarri was annoyed at their complacency.

Maurizio Sarri’s men looked relatively untroubled for 59 minutes and led through a goal from Ruben Loftus-Cheek. But Kepa allowed a Raul Jimenez shot to creep past him on 59 minutes to trigger a memorable Wolves fightback that was completed when Diogo Jota side-footed home from a Matt Doherty cross.

Neil Warnock’s side have suffered nine league defeats already this season, the latest of which came in a 1-0 loss to Everton last weekend, and they therefore sit level on points with Southampton and Fulham in the bottom three. Wolves however are without a win since their 1-0 win at Crystal Palace in early October, and succumbed to a surprising 2-0 defeat to Huddersfield Town last weekend.
