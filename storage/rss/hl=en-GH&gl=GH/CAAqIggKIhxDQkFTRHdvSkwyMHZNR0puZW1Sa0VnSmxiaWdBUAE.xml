Akufo-Addo named 50 deputy ministers and four ministers of state on Wednesday in addition to 56 ministers and deputies previously announced. It is the largest government since the West African country adopted a democratic constitution in 1992.

The outcry on social and national media over Saturday's speech took the shine off a moment of triumph for the former opposition leader, who won a convincing victory in December after twice losing battles for the presidency.
