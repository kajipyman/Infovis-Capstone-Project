Mourinho has cut an embattled figure for most of the campaign because of issues related to United’s summer transfer policy, his relationship with Paul Pogba and poor league form that has left his team 18 points behind the leaders, Manchester City, after 15 matches.

It was almost 12 months ago to the day that Mourinho was talking about Manchester United being an inferior proposition without the France midfielder. Now Pogba, dropped for the second time in three games, is a “virus” who overcomplicates things and is as expendable as the rest of them.

Now, as a result of some supernatural, Capra-esque shenanigans, he’s been teleported into an alternative existence: a doting father of two working as a tyre salesman in the New Jersey suburbs, scrimping and saving, trapped for eternity in domestic monotony.

The French World Cup winner, and recent recipient of the inaugural Kopa Trophy, an award for the best under-21 player in the world, was in contact with Wenger about a potential move to London. The former Monaco star instead chose the French champions but said Wenger acted like a ‘gentleman’ when he decided to reject Arsenal. 13 players Arsene Wenger tried to sign for Arsenal - 13 sho...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Manchester United vs Arsenal LIVE - What time does it start, TV channel, where can I watch it, prediction, odds - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-united-vs-arsenal-live-score-goals-updates-fc-prediction-result-2018-epl-time-tv-channel-a8668776.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEANO9jp3mtEi9xHHq6Jj9HcqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTC8yxU</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:49:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-united-vs-arsenal-live-score-goals-updates-fc-prediction-result-2018-epl-time-tv-channel-a8668776.html" target="_blank"&gt;Manchester United vs Arsenal LIVE - What time does it start, TV channel, where can I watch it, prediction, odds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchester United will hope to end a run of three Premier League games without a win, but face an uphill challenge against an Arsenal side on a run of 19 matches unbeaten and buoyed by Sunday's north London derby victory over Tottenham. Jose Mourinho's side are facing a crucial moment in their season following their 2-2 draw with Southampton at the weekend, with reports of fall outs between the manager and certain players emerging along with a defensive injury crisis that is seriously impacting their hopes of finishing inside the top four.

Kante proved to be one of the players of the season last year as he excelled during a tricky campaign for Chelsea, but the arrival of Jorginho as Sarri’s key man in midfield has seen the World Cup winner ousted from his previous position in front of the defensive line and shifted forwards to accommodate the Italy international.

Mauricio Pochettino is achieving brilliant things with Spurs and despite a quiet summer transfer window, has them sitting in third place, looking good. Unai Emery has lifted the mood at Arsenal and represents the face of change. Having had time to settle in and integrate his ideas, the north London derby represents a first genuinely massive test. So, where might both teams gain an advantage? Keeping balance Arsenal have played with a 4-2-3-1 since the start of the season, with two defensive midfielders providing protection to the defence.

He needs a team to play like one, for individuals to act as though fused together, working towards a collective goal, showing heart, fight and focus. This current Man Utd team is occasionally half-decent and has some massive names who turn up sporadically, but as a unit, it appears devoid of identity. If Mourinho is trying to fire up his players and have the team play in his image, he's either not doing it very well or has a squad full of the wrong type of person.

The Italian added that talks over a new deal for the player take place every week at the club. The Belgium playmaker's current deal runs until June 2020 and the 27-year-old has admitted his quandary over whether to re-sign with the Blues or seek a "dream" move to Real Madrid.
