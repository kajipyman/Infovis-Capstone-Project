In the days since the New York Timesdetailed Facebook\u2019s efforts to use antisemitic language to smear political opponents, one question has been whether Clegg will actually show for work in January, when his job starts. Why would someone with such a sterling r\u00e9sum\u00e9 want to clean such a disgusting mess? Yet Facebook executives may have chosen the perfect man for the task. That is, if their aim is to shutter their deeply troubled corporation. Clegg, after all, is the m..."

The 223 pages of internal communication from 2012 to 2015 between high-level employees, including founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, provide new evidence of previously aired contentions that Facebook has picked favorites and engaged in anti-competitive behavior. The documents show that Facebook tracked growth of competitor..."

There seems to be mounting opinion linking the increase in populism around the world with the popularization of a technology that within a few years has come to monopolize a good part of the time, the thoughts and even how we consume news: the social networks. The relationship between populism and social networks cover more aspects than are usually considered. The awareness of some politicians that social networks, oriented to marketing and hyper-segmented campaigns, offer the perfect way to spread their message is only one facet. Figur..."

(JOEL SAGET/AFP/Getty Images) In response to the release earlier today of the Six4Three collection of internal Facebook emails, Mark Zuckerberg issued a statement largely downplaying the significance of the emails that the company had fought so heavily to keep secret. His statement largely acknowledges Facebook\u2019s focus on generating revenue and the fact that as a for-profit company it must be \u201ceconomically sustainable.\u201d One line in his statement, however, is striking for the way it juxtapositions Facebook\u2019s perceived role in the online ecosystem compared with traditional comm..."
