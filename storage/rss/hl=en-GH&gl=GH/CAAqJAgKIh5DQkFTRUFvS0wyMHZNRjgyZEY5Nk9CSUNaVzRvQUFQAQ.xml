However, it has been a long time since women have been incorporated into the labor market, and yet this has not led to a division of tasks between women and men regarding childcare. On the contrary, women have gained more responsibilities in the workplace without reducing the ones they had at home.

The Brexit deal is proving a tough sell, and May is coming under increasing pressure to delay a parliamentary vote scheduled for next week in hopes of wringing concessions out of the EU.

The endless talk of backstops in the Brexit debate has somewhat overshadowed the fact that the UK is a service-based economy, and for a big chunk of its exports, customs borders are not really the point. Services trade has been relatively absent for much of the discussion about Britain’s relationship with the EU, most likely for several interconnected reasons.

In that time there’s been plenty of talk as to how to enact the withdrawal but very little action. This means that, with less than four months to go until the UK is set to withdraw from the trading block, the squabbling, backbiting and sheer panic in Westminster has reached fever pitch.

The "Globalisation Fund" would be used to help fund public services, training and infrastructure in some of the UK's most deprived areas. It would likely replace the government's existing Controlling Migration Fund which serves a similar purpose but amounts to just £35m a year. EU migrants contribute £4.7bn more in taxes than they receive in welfare payments and public services each year, according to government analysis.

It was back to the European Free Trade Association (Efta), of which the UK was a member before 1973. Nothing else made sense. As a Eurosceptic, I voted to remain only because I thought it wrong for Britain to leave Europe’s one conclave of nations just when it was growing seriously unstable. The vote to leave had to be honoured. It was doable. But to abandon the customs union and single market was not doable. It was reckless.
