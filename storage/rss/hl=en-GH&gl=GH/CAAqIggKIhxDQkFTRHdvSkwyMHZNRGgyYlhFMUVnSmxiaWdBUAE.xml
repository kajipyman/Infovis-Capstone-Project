Just one day after the Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari denied claims he had died and been replaced by a Sudanese impostor “clone”, another world leader has been forced to address rumours of his demise.

Responding to a presidency statement issued late on Friday, opposition leader Jean Ping branded the proposal for talks starting on March 28 as a "masquerade" and said he would not participate.
