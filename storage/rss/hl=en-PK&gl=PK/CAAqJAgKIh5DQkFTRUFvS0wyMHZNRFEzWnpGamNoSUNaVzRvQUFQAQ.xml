Mickey Arthur said after the first Test here in Abu Dhabi that Pakistan cricket had the ability to move on, and it looks like they've moved on without learning a single thing from it.

Only once had a team batting first lost a Test match in Abu Dhabi, but the way the visitors played, they may already be on course to add to that list. There was precious little resistance with the bat, one solid partnership between Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls excepted, with every Pakistan bowler among the wickets as they skittled Williamson's men out for 153, the lowest-ever first-innings total in Abu Dhabi.

Eoin Morgan, England’s Twenty20 skipper, said that telling Root about the decision was one of the hardest conversations he has had in the role. Root was omitted for the returning Ben Stokes, who came in for the deciding T20 international against India when it was clear he would be able to bowl. “Dropping Joe is not an easy decision,” Morgan said. “Trying to win the game on this particular ground [Bristol], it actually came down to Ben’s bowling option.

Captain Kane Williamson lauded the way CSK handled the most high-pressure match of the lot, the final, not giving Sunrisers any opportunities while chasing what he thought was a "competitive total". In pursuit of 179, CSK lost only two wickets and ensured Sunrisers' most dangerous bowlers - Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Rashid Khan - went wicketless. "That is the nature of that - sometimes you do have to applaud very good cricket and that was CSK in terms of their batting today," Williamson...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricinfo</source></item><item><title>Williamson hails Sunrisers' hard scrap - ESPNCricinfo</title><link>http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23606088/kane-williamson-hails-sunrisers-hard-scrap</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJtXNInISv-F8u83DJO04VUqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow7qimATDOxAowov85</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2018 02:10:16 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23606088/kane-williamson-hails-sunrisers-hard-scrap" target="_blank"&gt;Williamson hails Sunrisers' hard scrap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ESPNCricinfo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two nights after being pipped by a late Faf du Plessis onslaught that cost them a four-day break and a direct entry into the final, Sunrisers Hyderabad did it the hard way at Eden Gardens. They snapped a four-match losing streak by beating Kolkata Knight Riders by 14 runs to enter their second IPL final and have another crack at Chennai Super Kings, who they are yet to beat in three attempts this season.

And now they face off for the fourth time this season, after overcoming very different challenges. Sunrisers Hyderabad will play their second IPL final but for their new captain Kane Williamson, it will be his first. They have largely banked on Williamson's batting and strangled oppositions with their bowling attack, and Sunrisers coach Tom Moody said succeeding on different kind of pitches - especially adapting to flat ones - was their strength.

Three wickets, including of the highest scorer and the biggest hitter in the opposition. One run-out of a batsman proving to be a great tactical move. Two catches.
