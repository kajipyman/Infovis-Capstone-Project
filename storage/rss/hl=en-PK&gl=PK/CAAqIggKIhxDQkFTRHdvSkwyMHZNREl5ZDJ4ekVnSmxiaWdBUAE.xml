Fuel oil — a heavy and dirty source of energy used to power cargo vessels — faces stricter global rules on sulphur emissions in two years’ time. Ben Luckock, co-head of group market risk at independent trader Trafigura, said: “The days of people wondering whether this change would occur are gone.

Beginning in 2020, shipping vessels will not be allowed to burn fuel with a sulfur content higher than 0.5 percent, down from 3.5 percent currently.
