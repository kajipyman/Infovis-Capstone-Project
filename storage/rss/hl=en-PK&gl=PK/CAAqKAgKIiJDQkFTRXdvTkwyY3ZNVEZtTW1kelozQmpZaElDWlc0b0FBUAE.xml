The case of Aasia Bibi has become a political minefield for Prime Minister Imran Khan. He is trying to placate the Muslim extremists who have threatened to topple his government, while keeping the 54-year-old mother of five safe from a lynch mob and also finding a way to allow her to leave Pakistan without ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.apnews.com">The Associated Press</source></item><item><title>Asia Bibi, the Christian Pakistani woman acquitted of blasphemy, seeks asylum in the Netherlands, lawyer says - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/asia/asia-bibi-pakistan-asylum-intl/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHjbsR_oogA6CwGK8yUf3qQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMPvTpgU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 21:36:41 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/asia/asia-bibi-pakistan-asylum-intl/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Asia Bibi, the Christian Pakistani woman acquitted of blasphemy, seeks asylum in the Netherlands, lawyer says&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;An asylum application has been filed in the Netherlands for Asia Bibi, the Christian Pakistani woman acquitted last week of blasphemy charges, her lawyer told CNN on Thursday.
