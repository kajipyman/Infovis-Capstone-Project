Arthur was disappointed at the choice of shots under pressure, but backed his players to put it behind them ahead of the second Test. "Our choice of shots under pressure and the decisions we made were disappointing," he told ESPNcricinfo. "The game was wrapped up and suddenly we had the Babar Azam run out and we couldn't get over the line. It was incredibly disappointing. But everyone's hurting so much.

Wednesday's suicide blast in Kabul's diplomatic district killed at least 90 people and left 400 others wounded. While there has been no claim of responsibility, Afghanistan's intelligence agency has blamed Pakistan and the Taliban-linked Haqqani network for the attack.

He was the most notable omission from the list, with his fitness having been a major concern for much of his career. Akmal was originally named in the Champions Trophy squad but was axed after failing two fitness tests leading up to the start of the tournament in England. Akmal had previously been dropped from a tour of the West Indies in April for similar reasons.

Sharjeel, playing for Islamabad United, was charged with five major breaches of the PCB's anti-corruption code and was found guilty on all five counts by a three-man tribunal. Two-and-a-half years out of the five-year sentence are suspended, meaning Sharjeel, 28, cannot plot a return to cricket before the second half of 2019 at the earliest. Sharjeel was present at his sentencing but did not take questions. Potentially,...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricinfo</source></item></channel></rss>
