Would he or would he not be the supreme commander of the multinational Saudi-led “Islamic military alliance” created by Riyadh in 2015. Sharif himself never commented. Then quietly in late April he and his family arrived in Riyadh to take up the job with very little fanfare. His assumption of command raises more questions. Sharif, 60, retired as Pakistan’s chief of army staff last fall.
