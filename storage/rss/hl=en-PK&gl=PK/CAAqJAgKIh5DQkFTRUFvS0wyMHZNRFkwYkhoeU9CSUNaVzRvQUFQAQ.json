Mickey Arthur said after the first Test here in Abu Dhabi that Pakistan cricket had the ability to move on, and it looks like they've moved on without learning a single thing from it. A remarkable turnaround from New Zealand produced a result that is more a heist than a series win. After the sm..."

Defeat to New Zealand on the final day in Abu Dhabi consigned Sarfraz to a fourth loss in seven home Tests, a stark contrast to the seven years that preceded his ascension. Asked whether there could come a time in South Africa when he reconsiders the Test captaincy, Sarfraz said, \"When things like this happen, you do start to think about it. \"But let's see what happens.

Some fell in a freaky manner, like Babar Azam dragging it on off his bat and both legs onto the stumps.
