Opec and allies including Russia, which together account for half of the world’s oil production, have committed to reducing output by around 1.2mb/d a day. The price of international benchmark Brent crude has plunged by a third since the start of October to about $60 a barrel due to fears that the market is oversupplied.

"Yemen's future is in the hands of those in this room," Martin Griffiths, the UN envoy for Yemen said on Thursday in opening remarks at talks aimed at ending more than three years of war. "We must act now before we lose control of the future of Yemen," he said. "Both parties have called for a de-escalation, which is an important backdrop to these talks.

Some saw it as a sign that the group of oil-producing nations may not have the political unity to rein in supply and is suffering under political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to not push prices up again.

Israeli forces did not enter Lebanese territory, and there was no immediate reaction from Hezbollah. But the Israeli announcement threatened to push the bitter enemies closer to an open confrontation for the first time since a bruising 2006 war.

Hours before the meeting, US President Donald Trump called on OPEC and its allies to keep oil production high, so that prices remained low for the foreseeable future.
