Mickey Arthur said after the first Test here in Abu Dhabi that Pakistan cricket had the ability to move on, and it looks like they've moved on without learning a single thing from it.

Defeat to New Zealand on the final day in Abu Dhabi consigned Sarfraz to a fourth loss in seven home Tests, a stark contrast to the seven years that preceded his ascension. Asked whether there could come a time in South Africa when he reconsiders the Test captaincy, Sarfraz said, "When things like this happen, you do start to think about it. "But let's see what happens.

It had looked every inch the average game you would expect against a depleted West Indies side before lesser-known Jason Mohammed dismantled Pakistan's fabled fast-bowling attack, sealing a chase of 309 with an over to spare. As a result, they prepare for the second game in the knowledge that they have the opportunity to wrap up a long-awaited series win against a top side.

There were echoes of last season’s climax in that Ryan Sidebottom was batting when the championship was effectively clinched, but it was not Yorkshire’s long-haired left-armer but an Australian of the same name when Essex took the final wicket.
