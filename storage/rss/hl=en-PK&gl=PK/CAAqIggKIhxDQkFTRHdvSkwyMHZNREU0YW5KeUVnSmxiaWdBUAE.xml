While I agreed that certain metrics should be considered based on the current business environment, there are others that need to be based on the factors most important to the business — not on what others may have adopted or on some trend of the day. Ultimately, impactful metrics are a combination of both. Today, there are more HR metrics available than any single organization can use effectively.

But this was more of an external document to use with third parties like venture capitalists or banks. Building an internal, long-term strategic plan for the business, that is going to guide management with its decision making, is different. It is a lot more detailed and can take months to create.

In my 30 years in the workforce, I have worked for many leaders, and I cannot think of one good leader who was not also a good communicator. Quite simply, if a leader cannot communicate, she or he cannot lead. Similarly, an organization cannot be effective without solid, well-understood and easily digestible communications.

The holidays are often the busiest time of year and there’s the added pressure of trying to finish up everything before December 31st. What’s often overlooked, however, is the valuable opportunity this time of year offers. The last month of the year is the prime time to look back at the previous 12 months and set goals for the next 12.
