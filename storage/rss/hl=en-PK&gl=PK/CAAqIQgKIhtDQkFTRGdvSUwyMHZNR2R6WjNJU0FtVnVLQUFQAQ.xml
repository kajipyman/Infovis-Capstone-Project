Bush on Monday night, following his death at the age of 94 on Friday. And although the “Cuomo Prime Time” host didn’t mention Donald Trump by name, his eulogy acted as a blistering critique of the current White House. “Bush wasn’t perfect, he made his mistakes, his campaign brought us the Willie Horton ad, the Iran Contra pardons and a conspicuous reluctance to embrace the AIDS crisis — and of course there was ‘read my lips, no new taxes,’” Cuomo said.
