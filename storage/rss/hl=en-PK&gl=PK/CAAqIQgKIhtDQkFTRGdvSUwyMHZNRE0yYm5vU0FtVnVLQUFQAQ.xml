The Government has announced a phased increase to commercial quotas for the much sought after western rock lobster. The changes will see the current total allowable commercial catch (TACC) increase from 6,300 tonnes to 8,000 tonnes. But as part of the move the Government will directly control 1,385 tonnes of the catch. Matt Taylor from the Western Rock Lobster Council says that is an unprecedented intervention in the market.

Russia's defence ministry said rebels fired weapons containing chlorine on November 24 on the government-held city of Aleppo, with Syrian state media reporting that around 100 Syrians were hospitalised for breathing difficulties.
