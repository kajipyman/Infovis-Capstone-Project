Assange fled Sweden in 2012 over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Though prosecutors dropped the case last year, he still faces arrest for breaching bail conditions should he leave the embassy.

On Tuesday, The Guardian reported that Manafort had secretly met several times with Assange inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, including around the time he was made a top figure in the Trump campaign. The Guardian, citing sources, said Manafort had met with Assange in 2013, 2015 and in the spring of 2016. Manafort responded to The Guardian's report by calling it "totally false and deliberately libelous."
