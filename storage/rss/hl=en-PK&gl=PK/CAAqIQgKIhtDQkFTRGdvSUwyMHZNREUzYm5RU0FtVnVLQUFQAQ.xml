The Gates Notes/LLC and Getty Images During the Industrial Revolution, many people feared that the emergence of new technologies — textile mills, factories, steam-powered manufacturing — would eliminate their jobs. Labors, artisans, and farm workers who relied on their physical toil to make a living revolted against the machines.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are getting hammered as investors sell their shares and retreat into safer territory. The founders, CEOs and top investors in those companies are losing money quickly. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has lost roughly $42 billion since his net worth and peaked in early September at $168 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Amazon's stock (AMZN) has dropped more than 25% since then and is currently trading around $1,500 a share, leaving Bezos with a $126 billion nest egg...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item><item><title>"It captures a lot of truths."
