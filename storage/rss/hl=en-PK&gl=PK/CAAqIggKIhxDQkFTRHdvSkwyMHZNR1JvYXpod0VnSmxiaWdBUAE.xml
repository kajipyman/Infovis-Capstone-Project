He climbs on top of a shipping container, his white shalwar kameez fluttering behind him, and leans over the railing to salute hundreds of flag waving supporters. “This is the moment of change for Pakistan,” he bellows. “I will deliver a Pakistan which is different.” Mr Khan, the country’s charismatic former cricket captain, has for the past few weeks been delivering the same message at rallies across the country, attracting crowds of several th...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item><item><title>Security tightened as Pakistan braces for more election violence - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/18/asia/pakistan-election-security-intl/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPBnfaW6WJfCZ0aalYAbAgAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMPrTpgU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2018 02:32:19 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/18/asia/pakistan-election-security-intl/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Security tightened as Pakistan braces for more election violence&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is due to vote next week in general elections overshadowed by deadly terrorist attacks, hundreds of arrests and accusations of widespread interference by the military. The run up to the July 25 elections have seen a massive crackdown on the media and allegations the military has secretly backed the campaign of former cricketer Imran Khan while targeting his political opponents. Controversy has also arisen over allowing militant groups to participate in the poll.

It is indeed uplifting to see the world rejoice at her good fortune. While there are the detractors and naysayers, the barrage of good wishes, the #knitforJacinda campaign and countless other little gestures, has been overwhelmingly positive. But it was only natural for me to look back and compare this situation with the one my mother faced 28 years ago when she became the first world leader to give birth while in office. At the time, as her children, we didn’t appreciate how extraordinary her life was.

Speaking at a rally to mark the tenth anniversary of Bhutto's murder in the southern Pakistani town of Garhi Khuda Bux on Wednesday, Bilawal led a crowd of thousands in a chant declaring Musharraf "a murderer".

Most remember the moment when news of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's death spread and parts of the country succumbed to turmoil. Ten years later, Bhutto has not been forgotten. Her name and face appear frequently on billboards and election materials, as candidates continue to exploit her legacy for votes. Schools, colleges, airports and hospitals are named after her. There are social welfare schemes in her name. She even has a district named after her - Benazirabad.

Twice prime minister of Pakistan, BB was an extraordinary woman who went storming to the top, overturning prejudices as she went. Never before had a Muslim majority country had a female prime minister and never before had the Oxford Union had a female Asian president, but she was both. BB put her tea down and a smile crept across her face: ‘Desmond, I have never played it safe’ It was during her time in exile that we became friends.
