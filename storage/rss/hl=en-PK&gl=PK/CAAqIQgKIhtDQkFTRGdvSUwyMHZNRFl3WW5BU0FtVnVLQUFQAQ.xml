Prodi, who twice served as Italian prime minister and had Jean-Claude Juncker’s job until 2004, said that the EU needed to do everything it could to avoid the “economic catastrophe” of a no-deal Brexit. On signing an agreement with the British prime minister last month, Juncker described the draft withdrawal treaty and accompanying political declaration on the future relationship as “the deal – the only deal possible”.

The finer points of history — that most governments start out pretty wobbly, hit a sweet spot then head for a gradual decline to political and/or policy ordinariness and eventual defeat — can be lost or forgotten. The striking thing about the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison Government that has technically been in government — though not always able to govern itself let alone the rest of us — since 2013 is that it is hard to say exactly where its sweet spot was.
