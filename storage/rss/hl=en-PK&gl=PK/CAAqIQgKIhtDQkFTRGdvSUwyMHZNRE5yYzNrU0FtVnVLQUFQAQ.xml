As the youngest of three girls, by the time she arrived, her parents’ business was doing well enough for the family to buy a house in the wealthy suburb of Scarsdale, NY. Yahlin had many advantages growing up in Scarsdale. But she also had some disadvantages, like the fact that her parents weren’t able to communicate fluently in English and Yahlin never really learned Taiwanese. So rather than talking during dinner, the entire family would watch Dallas and Dynasty – which explains Yahlin’s career as a TV writer.
