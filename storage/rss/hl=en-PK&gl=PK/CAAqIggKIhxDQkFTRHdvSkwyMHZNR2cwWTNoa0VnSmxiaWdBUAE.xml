For years right-wing Hindu groups have demanded an end to the slaughter of cows, which are considered holy in Hinduism. But most of the beef produced in India comes from buffalo rather than cattle, prompting some critics to suggest the latest move is motivated by politics and religion.

Modi was speaking a week after a 16-year old Muslim boy was stabbed to death on a train on suspicion of possessing beef, the latest of an estimated 28 people killed in cow-related violence since 2010. Most of the victims were killed after Modi and his Hindu nationalist party won elections three years ago.

Reeling from a crash in commodity prices, more than 50,000 farmers from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a top producer of wheat and cane, blocked part of the main highway to the capital.

This year, India has once again been shaken by a heinous rape — this time of an eight-year-old girl from a semi-nomadic tribe of shepherds in the northern Jammu region.

Celebrities, writers, academicians, rights activists, lawyers and other professionals rubbed shoulders with the hoi-polloi. People were angry but only a few shouted slogans.
