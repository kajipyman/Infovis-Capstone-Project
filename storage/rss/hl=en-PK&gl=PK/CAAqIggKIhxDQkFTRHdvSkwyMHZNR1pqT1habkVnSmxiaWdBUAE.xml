At first glance, it is tempting to conclude that the United States has made the riskier bet. Not only has it soiled itself by association with the author of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, but it has also tethered its interests in the Middle East to a heedless ruler whose combination of youth and a penchant for blundering on an epic scale promises negative dividends for years and even decades to come...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.aljazeera.com">Al Jazeera English</source></item><item><title>Senators wrestle with rebuke of Saudis for Khashoggi killing - The Associated Press</title><link>https://www.apnews.com/0455566e183945beb7946ea7a04fde8b</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEDKgIva6mXQofSNrSXuxPEYqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowhO7OATDh9Cgwv7tQ</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 03:18:16 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.apnews.com/0455566e183945beb7946ea7a04fde8b" target="_blank"&gt;Senators wrestle with rebuke of Saudis for Khashoggi killing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Senators are considering multiple pieces of legislation to formally rebuke Saudi Arabia for the slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with momentum building for a resolution to call Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman complicit in the killing.
