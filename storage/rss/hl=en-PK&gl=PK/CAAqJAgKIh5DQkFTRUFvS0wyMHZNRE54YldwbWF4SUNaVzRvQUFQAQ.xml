Sharif's wife Kulsoom won the by-election with 49.3 percent of the vote in the eastern city of Lahore - a handsome margin of victory but down from the 61 percent garnered by the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party in the constituency in an election in 2013.

Pakistan's foreign ministry called for the United States to amend its statement, but U.S. State Department said it stands by its account. The row comes ahead of a planned visit by Pompeo to Islamabad in the first week of September to meet with Khan, who was sworn in as prime minister last week.

Khan, who took office as Pakistani Prime Minister at the weekend, has proposed talks to resolve a long-standing dispute over the Kashmir region. He spoke to Indian premier Narendra Modi by telephone in late July. Speaking ahead of the first meeting of Khan's cabinet, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said it was vital to resume talks, which have made little progres...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>Imran Khan sheds hundreds of servants and says Pakistan's elite must pay tax as his first cabinet is sworn in - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/imran-khan-pakistan-tax-rich-prime-minister-servants-cabinet-swearing-in-a8499591.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJNovHSvW9bBZnDiY7ujtSwqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCRx_0F</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:36:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/imran-khan-pakistan-tax-rich-prime-minister-servants-cabinet-swearing-in-a8499591.html" target="_blank"&gt;Imran Khan sheds hundreds of servants and says Pakistan's elite must pay tax as his first cabinet is sworn in&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is to auction off a fleet of 88 luxury vehicles from the prime ministerial protocol after the new prime minister, former cricket star Imran Khan, declared he would live “a simple life” in office. On Monday, all 21 members of Mr Khan’s cabinet were sworn in in Islamabad, mostly political veterans to counterbalance the relative inexperience of the new prime minister himself who – at 65 years old – has never previously held office. In his first speech as prime minister, Mr Khan announced he would pursue a policy of austerity, seeking to wean the country off its huge debts. - Read more...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Imran Khan to scrap hundreds of staff and move to three-bed home as he pledges new austerity drive for Pakistan - The Telegraph</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/20/imran-khan-scrap-hundreds-staff-move-three-bed-home-pledges/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOkWaA0CynDYcsU_C1z7UAUqFggEKg4IACoGCAowm6R6MMKqCTCfrxU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:31:57 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/20/imran-khan-scrap-hundreds-staff-move-three-bed-home-pledges/" target="_blank"&gt;Imran Khan to scrap hundreds of staff and move to three-bed home as he pledges new austerity drive for Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imran Khan will forego the lavish lodgings normally used by Pakistan's prime ministers and live in a three-bedroom house with the use of only two servants rather than hundreds, he said. The newly sworn in leader used his first address to the nation pledge a new austerity drive and rail against waste as his country faces a severe economic crisis. The former cricket hero said it was shameful that the sprawling prim minister's house had 524 staff and a fleet of 80 vehicles, 33 of them bullet proof. He would keep two and sell the rest, he said. “I want to tell my people, I will live a simple li...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.telegraph.co.uk">The Telegraph</source></item></channel></rss>
