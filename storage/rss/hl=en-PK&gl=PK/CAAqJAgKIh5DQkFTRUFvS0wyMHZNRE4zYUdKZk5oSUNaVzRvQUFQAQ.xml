A decades-old dispute over the mostly Muslim Himalayan region of Kashmir, claimed in full but ruled in part by both Pakistan and India, has heated up in recent years after a 2003 ceasefire brought more than a decade of relative peace.

Pakistan’s policy on Afghanistan has alienated Nato allies, which still have troops in Afghanistan. Only China, Russia and Turkey have so far stood up for Islamabad.
