            "desc": "The Skills Required For Preventative Healthcare The World Health Organization famously define health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\u201d so whilst it\u2019s perhaps long overdue, it\u2019s not surprising that a growing number of healthcare providers are turning their attention to preventing disease rather than just curing it. The UK\u2019s new health minister Matt Hancock has made prevention a fundamental tranche of his tenure, and outlined his vision for prevention in a recently published paper, in which he identified prevent..."

According to a study published in a Journal of Psychiatric Research, adopting a pet could offer respite to those with severe depression that has low rates of remission and cannot be easily treated with antidepressant medications or psychotherapy. Two Portuguese researchers recruited 80 participants with this kind of depression, known as \"treatment-resistant major depressive disorder\u201d, and found t..."
