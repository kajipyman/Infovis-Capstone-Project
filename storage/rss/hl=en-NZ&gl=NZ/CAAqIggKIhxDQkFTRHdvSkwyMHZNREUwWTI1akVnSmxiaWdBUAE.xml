After graduating from law school three years earlier, he was stuck making monthly payments on $100,000 worth of loans, and wasn’t even beginning to chip away at the principal. But Lakier qualified for a federal student loan forgiveness program. “The plan was, I would wait 20 years and if I made those minimum payments, the rest would be forgiven,” he remembers. His employer at the time, Ernst &amp; Young, had recently begun offering a discount on student loan refinancing as part of its employee benefits package.

Getty Images In some states, 2019 could be the year student loan laws change. Over the past few years, borrower advocates have been pushing state lawmakers across the country to adopt measures that increase their oversight over student-loan companies. Some states have succeeded in passing these bills, but in others, they’ve struggled to turn the proposals into law. Next year could be the year that in som...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.marketwatch.com">MarketWatch</source></item><item><title>Barnes &amp; Noble Education Has A Mixed Q2 - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenduffer/2018/12/06/barnes-noble-education-has-a-mixed-q2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEN35AvOyG6Jtlvnobilk99gqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMJGBAg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 13:58:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenduffer/2018/12/06/barnes-noble-education-has-a-mixed-q2/" target="_blank"&gt;Barnes &amp; Noble Education Has A Mixed Q2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;People walk into a cafe at the newly opened Barnes &amp; Noble book store in Campus Town at The College of New Jersey Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015, in Ewing Township, N.J.

(AP) — An Arkansas school district that ordered a student newspaper to take down an investigative report now says the article can be re-published on its website. A spokesman for the Springdale School District said Tuesday the Har-ber Herald could republish its months-long investigation into the transfer of six football players to a rival high school. The article alleged the students transferred for athletic, not academic reasons, which would violate district policy. Springdale had ordered the article be taken off the paper's website in November and had effectively suspende...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://apnews.com">The Associated Press</source></item><item><title>Nobel winner Donna Strickland: ‘I was about 10 when I saw my first laser.

These fields are historically male-dominated. We rely on Stem disciplines, and the problem-solving and critical-thinking skills they develop, to help address some of the most pressing challenges the world faces.
