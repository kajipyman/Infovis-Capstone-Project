Chris Gursky's is painfully terrifying -- best watched while peeking through your fingers. Gursky, an American, was on his first day of a vacation in Switzerland when he decided to take a tandem hang gliding ride over the Alpine scenery. Unfortunately, he says, the hang gliding instructor failed to attach his safety harness. As soon as the hang glider left the ground, Gursky was left clinging on with his bare hands, desperately trying not to fall as the ground dropped away beneath them.

It was the first moment during my three-month paramotor journey, following Bewick’s swans as they migrated from Russia’s Arctic tundra to Britain, that I’d had time to think about coming home. When you’re high enough in the sky the air is amazingly clear, and I saw the cliffs as a big smile in the distance. Like the swans, my epic 7,000-mile migration was nearly complete: Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire, our final destination, was just a few days flight away. I burst into tears.
