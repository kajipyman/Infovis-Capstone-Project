A year on, Ms Ardern is New Zealand's Prime Minister, the third woman and the youngest person to have held the role in 150 years. She is comfortably the most popular politician in the land, and one of the brightest stars in the international political firmament.

Relations between the Pacific neighbours have been growing noticeably frostier since Jacinda Ardern’s leave of absence, amid Australia’s continual deportation of New Zealand citizens. Experts say the increasing tensions are fundamentally altering the once robust and “special” relationship. Related: Bad neighbours?

The two countries have been exchanging barbs over Australia's so-called character test, which has resulted in a rise in the number of New Zealanders being deported from the country.

During New Zealand's failed 2016 referendum on replacing its flag, confusion between the Australian and Kiwi ensigns was often raised by those looking for change. Asked about the matter this week, New Zealand Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters — whose party fiercely opposed a change — blamed Australia.

Just ten days after the birth of her daughter, named Neve, Ms Ardern posted a video on Facebook to announce the start of a package to boost family incomes.
