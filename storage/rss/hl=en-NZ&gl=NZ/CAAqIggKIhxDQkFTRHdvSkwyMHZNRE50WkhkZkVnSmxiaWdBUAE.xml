Nabra Hassanen, 17, was killed with a baseball bat Sunday in what police controversially described as a “road rage” incident. John Solomon, 24, of South Carolina, was arrested just after 10:00am Wednesday, US Park Police spokeswoman Sergeant Anna Rose said. “At this time, the incident does not appear to be motivated by bias,” she said, according to the New York Daily News. Solomon was reportedly setting several objects on fire at the park.

In total, 80 per cent of drivers – four in every five – have been the victim of some form of road rage aggression.
