National and Labour had been almost neck and neck in opinion polls, with charismatic 37-year old Jacinda Ardern almost single-handedly dragging Labour back into the race after taking over the party's leadership in August. Prime Minister Bill English claimed victory on Saturday after the National Party took 46 percent of the votes and 58 seats - three less than the required 61 needed to govern.
