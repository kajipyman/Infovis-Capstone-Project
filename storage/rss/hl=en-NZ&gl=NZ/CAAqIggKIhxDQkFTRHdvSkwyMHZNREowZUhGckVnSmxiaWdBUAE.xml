But the 2015 deal that it described as a “game changer” has turned sour. Its Chinese partner has lost 70 per cent of its market value in three years. Both companies have been critical of each other and some of Fonterra’s 10,500 farmer shareholders are questioning whether the co-operative should dump its investment.
