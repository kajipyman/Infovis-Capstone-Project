Mickey Arthur said after the first Test here in Abu Dhabi that Pakistan cricket had the ability to move on, and it looks like they've moved on without learning a single thing from it.

Give them 20 overs to play, and they are unstoppable. They can defend low scores, chase tricky targets, go ballistic at the top, and inflict collapses. Ask them to go a little longer, for 50 overs, and all of a sudden, their batsmen are scratching around. Straightforward targets seem like insurmountable mountains. And the batting is more susceptible to collapses than blocks in a game of Jenga. It's almost as if they forget all the elements that enable them to succeed in the shortest format.

While Pakistan's T20I form over the last two years has defied logic, their ODI record against the stronger teams is almost the other side of that coin. Against Australia, South Africa, India, New Zealand and England over that same period, Pakistan have lost 17 out of 21 ODIs.

Rashid Khan single-handedly ended Sunrisers Hyderabad's four-match losing streak to beat Kolkata Knight Riders and set up fourth bout against Chennai Super Kings this season, this time for the IPL title. Sunrisers were 134 for 6 in 17.5 overs when Rashid came out to bat. He produced an innings to rattle the young Knight Riders bowlers much lik...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricinfo</source></item><item><title>We backed Carlos with his death bowling - Williamson - ESPNCricinfo</title><link>http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23573536/we-backed-carlos-death-bowling-kane-williamson</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENB8OOKFZwejggsN0uUEqm4qFwgEKg8IACoHCAow7qimATDOxAowov85</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 12:10:37 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23573536/we-backed-carlos-death-bowling-kane-williamson" target="_blank"&gt;We backed Carlos with his death bowling - Williamson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ESPNCricinfo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Bhuvneshwar Kumar has not been completely fit this tournament, he is the leader of the Sunrisers Hyderabad pace attack. Siddarth Kaul, meanwhile, has been their leading wicket-taker and arguably their best quick bowler this season, and he showed it when he bowled Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu off consecutive deliveries on Tuesday. So when Sunrisers had to defend 22 off two overs, who did Kane Williamson pick to bowl the 19th and who did he save for the end? "In terms of choosing between those two, they are both very good operators," Kane Williamson said in his post-match press conf...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricinfo</source></item><item><title>Faf du Plessis pulls off great escape to lead CSK into IPL final - ESPNCricinfo</title><link>http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/report/1136617/TBC-vs-TBC-Qualifier-1-Indian-Premier-League-2018</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPBoI8vGhRqcNde_j_fbEioqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow7qimATDOxAowov85</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 01:44:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/report/1136617/TBC-vs-TBC-Qualifier-1-Indian-Premier-League-2018" target="_blank"&gt;Faf du Plessis pulls off great escape to lead CSK into IPL final&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ESPNCricinfo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faf du Plessis, playing only his fifth match of the season, repaid his captain's faith by playing an innings MS Dhoni himself will be proud of. Chasing 140 to make their seventh final in nine attempts, Chennai Super Kings were reduced to 62 for 6 by the excellent Sunrisers Hyderabad bowling, but du Plessis took the game deep, induced a few errors from the opposition captain, and capitalised on small mistakes here and there. Carlos Brathwaite bowled the 18th over, with 43 to get, ahead of Sandeep Sharma and Shakib Al Hasan. Du Plessis hit that over for four, six and four to give an excellent...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricinfo</source></item><item><title>Pressure on Williamson in Sunrisers' last chance - ESPNCricinfo</title><link>http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/preview/1136619/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-qualifier-2-ipl</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEP61vQ0QEVNC9z3A7vPoz9EqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow7qimATDOxAowov85</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 21:28:49 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8048/preview/1136619/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-qualifier-2-ipl" target="_blank"&gt;Pressure on Williamson in Sunrisers' last chance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ESPNCricinfo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunrisers Hyderabad play the perfect game. That's why their wins in the league phase were so remarkable. To defend small totals, Bhuvneshwar Kumar had to outsmart the enemy. Siddharth Kaul had to frustrate them. And Rashid Khan had to deliver the knockout punch. The legspinner's lucky his googly has top-secret status. Batsmen under the age of 90 can't read it. And to chase 'em down, they needed Kane Williamson to understand that his mastery of defence has other uses as well. Like, when he extends his arms, while taking his usual care to pick the gaps, he can hit boundaries at will.
