Today, Greenland's ice sheets are melting at a rate 50% higher than pre-industrial levels and 33% above 20th-century levels, the scientists found.

The lead scientist on the paper, Dr Luke Trusel, said: “Melting of the Greenland ice sheet has gone into overdrive. “As a result, Greenland melt is adding to sea level more than any time during the last three-and-a-half centuries, if not thousands of years. “And increasing melt began around the same time as we started altering the atmosphere in the mid-1800s.” - Read more Civili...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Will Global Warming Shrink U.S. GDP 10%?

As the UN hosts its annual meeting on climate change this week, it is imperative that we continue to place an emphasis on the strongest evidence to inform how our society should respond.

The tiny island is home to 4,800 people, down from 7,000 a decade ago. "If a tsunami or a big cyclone hits this island we will be finished," said Sanjib Sagar, village leader on the island 150 km (93 miles) south of the Indian city of Kolkata.

But the awe quickly turns to horror, when you realize the photographs show the Arctic melting before our eyes. One of the leading causes of sea level rise is the melting of ice from glaciers and ice sheets. The Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea levels by more than 22 feet. As the world gets hotter, the ice will keep melting, and it has the potential to wipe out coastal cities all around the world–and submerge entire island countries under the water.
