Mickey Arthur said after the first Test here in Abu Dhabi that Pakistan cricket had the ability to move on, and it looks like they've moved on without learning a single thing from it.

They drop ritualistically, to their haunches to lay hands on the surface, sometimes feeling it with closed eyes, as if searching for the pitch's life force. Towards the end of the exercise, glances are often thrown skywards and divine guidance is sought. Occasionally, the pitch curator consulted.

On a night when floodlights and the pink ball ushered in Brisbane's biggest ever non-Ashes Test crowd, Pakistan allowed the throng of 26,343 to salute a century for Australia's captain Steven Smith with a pair of contrasting reprieves. The first, in the final over before the tea break, came via an unexpectedly sharp leg break from Azhar Ali and an equally surprising fumble behind the stumps by Sarfraz Ahmed.

In cricketing terms, a fourth-innings Test chase of nearly 500 has always been viewed as impossible. And with good reason: of all the 1504 times that a team has batted in the fourth innings of a Test, only once has that team scored more than 500.
