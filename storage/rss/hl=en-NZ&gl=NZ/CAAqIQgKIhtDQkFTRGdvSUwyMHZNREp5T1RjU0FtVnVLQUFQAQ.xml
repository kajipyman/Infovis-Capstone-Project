Here's why&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska is no stranger to earthquakes. In fact, it's the most seismically-active state in the US, experts say. The state also experienced the second-largest earthquake to ever hit the US -- a 9.2-magnitude in 1964. Friday's 7.0 magnitude earthquake near Anchorage is no surprise to experts. The state is located along the Pacific "Ring of Fire" and joins the Pacific and North American plates. The area is marked by subduction zones, where two of the Earth's tectonic plates meet, according to Randy Baldwin, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey.
