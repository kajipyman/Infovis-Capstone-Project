Earlier, the New Zealand Warriors continued their perfect record for 2018, with a comprehensive win over the Sydney Roosters. Trbojevic was at his elusive best at Brookvale Oval, setting up three tries and scoring one in a scintillating first half and adding a fourth assist in the second stanza.

At that stage England were cruising: 20-0 ahead, defensively impregnable and on their way to the World Cup final at a canter. But this is England’s rugby league side. They do not do things the easy way. In a cacophony of noise in Auckland – which, at first glance, looked and felt every inch like the Tongan capital of Nuku’alofa given the sea of red on show – England had ticked every box required of them in the opening hour.

For anyone connected to English rugby league it will be hard not to think back to 24 November 2013.

The Kiwis, finalists in the last three tournaments, looked a shadow of their former selves and Fiji took advantage to claim a 4-2 victory in a error-strewn first meeting between the sides. Fiji dominated the first half in Wellington but were too slow and laboured to break the Kiwis down as they failed to add to Apisai Koroisau's penalty.

They ran in 14 tries to one, with Peta Hiku and Te Maire Martin scoring hat-tricks. Full-back Roger Tuivasa-Sheck nabbed four assists in an utterly destructive attacking display.
