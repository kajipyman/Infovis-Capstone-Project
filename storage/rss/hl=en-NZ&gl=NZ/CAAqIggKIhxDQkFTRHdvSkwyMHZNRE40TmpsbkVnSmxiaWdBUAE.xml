Or why the majority of employees are checked out at work today? It’s because we aren’t talking about the most important thing at work: everyone’s mental health. If mindset is the most important thing to creating winning cultures, then why aren’t we talking about mental health as a key performance indicator of organizational success?

It has urged the government to widen provision of mental health care from 3% of the population in critical need to “the missing middle” – the 20% of the population who struggle with“common, disabling problems” such as anxiety.

But there are many ways in each to get healthier. Depending on the severity of symptoms, it is always a good idea to check in with a primary care physician.

That’s because the NHS is at last recognising not only that men have postnatal issues too, but that the wellbeing of new mothers is deeply dependent on supporting the skills and capacities of their children’s fathers.
