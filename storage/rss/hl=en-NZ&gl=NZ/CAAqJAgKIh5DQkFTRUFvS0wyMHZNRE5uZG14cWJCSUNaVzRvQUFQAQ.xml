It became a key text in something called the Mythopoetic Men’s Movement, a shared urge for men to retreat into the woods, bare their woad-smeared chests and generally nurture their inner scowling, bearded masculinity. Naturally this went down well with 1990s American men, who were delighted to discover they were in fact reservoirs of vibrant male “Zeus power” (High five! Brewskis!).

A magisterial display of the finest rugby': Telegraph readers on the weekend of sport&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heroic night in Dublin on Saturday evening cemented Ireland's position as one of the elite sides in the world of international rugby. But just how good are they? Can Ireland now be regarded as the best team in the world following their victory over New Zealand? A number of our readers argue for that being the case. Elsewhere, England were nearly made to pay for Eddie Jones' suggestion that they would 'smash' Japan with victory far less comfortably than expected at Twickenham on Saturday.

In an unforgettable final round Fury was caught and dropped with nearly two minutes left on the clock and went down flat on his back, his arms outstretched and his bruised head resting on the canvas as he stared high and blankly into the dark void up beyond the lights. He spent a year of his life looking at the same despairing emptiness and we will never know what he saw on Saturday night that allowed him to stir.

The British boxer returned from a lengthy lay-off due to drug addiction, alcoholism and mental health problems to the verge of becoming a two-time world champion after an expert display of tactical championship boxing Wilder's two knockdowns, in the ninth and 12th rounds, dragged him back into a contest he looked all set to lose as he keeps his WBC strap after an eighth title defence.

Fury will challenge Wilder for the one world heavyweight title he has never held at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles. During a promotional tour ahead of the fight, Fury said: "He hasn't got what he says he's got. I see fear in Deontay Wilder, I could sense his heartbeat through his suit.

The British heavyweight has shed over 130 pounds - almost 10 stones - in the last 12 months in preparation for his bout with Wilder, thanks to a carefully calibrated programme devised by his strength and conditioning coach Kristian Blacklock. It has left Fury, whose weight ballooned dramatically during his two-and-a-half-year absence from the ring between 2015 and last June, in his best physical shape in years as he...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.telegraph.co.uk">The Telegraph</source></item><item><title>Oleksandr Usyk ready to move to heavyweight but must wait for Anthony Joshua fight, says Eddie Hearn - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/oleksandr-usyk-heavyweight-anthony-joshua-schedule-tony-bellew-news-next-fight-a8652236.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEKjcNxnK47FZnWAqrJWDjpoqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCRx_0F</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 12:55:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/oleksandr-usyk-heavyweight-anthony-joshua-schedule-tony-bellew-news-next-fight-a8652236.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oleksandr Usyk ready to move to heavyweight but must wait for Anthony Joshua fight, says Eddie Hearn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddie Hearn has urged unified cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk to make the step up to the heavyweight following his title defence against Tony Bellew.
