Several rounds of severe thunderstorms are likely in the southern United States over the next couple of days as November fades into December. Severe weather during the late fall and early winter is a common hazard in the southern United States, made all the more dangerous due to the fact that fewer people are paying attention for warnings this time of year and it gets darker earlier, mitigating the ability to spot tornadoes before they strike.

It’s been quite the couple of weeks for pre-winter snowstorms in the center of the country and that trend doesn’t seem to want to stop as we head into the first weekend of December. A large low-pressure system developing over the central Plains right now looks like it’s on track to bring significant snows to the Plains and Midwest through the end of this weekend.

(AP) — Hailstorms inflict billions of dollars in damage yearly in North America alone, and the cost will rise as the growing population builds more homes, offices and factories, climate and weather experts said Tuesday. The role of climate change in hailstorms is harder to assess, the experts said at a conference at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Climate change will likely make large hailstorms worse, but population growth is more of a certainty, said Andreas Prein, a climate modeling scientist at the atmospheric research center.

The zoo will be closed Tuesday while it assesses the damage, marketing director Jenny Koch said.
