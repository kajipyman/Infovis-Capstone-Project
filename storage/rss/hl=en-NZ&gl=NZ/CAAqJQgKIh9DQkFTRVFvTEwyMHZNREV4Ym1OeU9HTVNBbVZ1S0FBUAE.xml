French President Emmanuel Macron has stayed out of the public eye all week, leaving his unpopular government to try to calm the nation. In response, "Macron, resign!" has become the main slogan of the "yellow vest" demonstrators.

CNN reporters on the ground also saw police fire rubber bullets. Police say several thousand protesters, most of them male and dressed in "gilets jaunes," the yellow high-visibility jackets that have become the symbol of the movement, converged on the Champs-Elysees at about 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) chanting "Down with Macron" and "Calm down police."

Some 89,000 officers, armored vehicles belonging to military police and increased vigilance – that’s how the nation is getting ready for Act IV, the fourth Saturday of Yellow Vest rallies. This time the protesters say they are to “stay on their course,” despite the authorities agreeing to abandon the fuel tax hike.

It was timed for the start of this year’s UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland 600 miles away.

Yet the "yellow-vest" movement -- named for the fluorescent jackets carried by French motorists -- remains an amorphous, hard-to-define group with a rapidly shifting agenda. It has no leader. It named eight spokespeople, some of whom disagreed with each other and one of whom was promptly sacked. Members are broadly opposed to decision-making authority.

The Franco-German engine has struck again and this time it’s ruffled some feathers. In a last-ditch attempt to strike a deal on an EU-wide tech tax for Emmanuel Macron, Paris and Berlin’s finance ministries have hatched an eleventh hour version of a “digital services tax” that dials down the ambition but will ramp up the pressure on resisters to finally swallow the idea.

The protesters are railing against fuel price hikes but also against the cancellation of the wealth tax, a decision that was made by French President Emmanuel Macron at the start of his five-year mandate and earned him the nickname "president of the rich".
