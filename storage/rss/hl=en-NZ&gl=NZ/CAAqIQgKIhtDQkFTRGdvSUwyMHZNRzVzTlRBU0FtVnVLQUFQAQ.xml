Sabrina Di Lembo, 19, took her own life in August 2017 after experiencing serious anxiety and panic attacks in the lead-up to university assessments and exams. In the last nine weeks of Sabrina's life, she had contact with Northern Territory health professionals on 17 separate occasions — and her mother Lidia had more than 20 interactions.

Shropshire Coroner's Court was told that Vicki Archer, who left work during a drivetime show, had a history of depression and had made two previous attempts on her life. The 41-year-old, who had emailed a colleague at BBC Radio Shropshire saying she was feeling upset, was found hanged in her house in Woodcote Way, Shrewsbury, on August 6 this year.
