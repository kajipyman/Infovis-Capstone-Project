But Northern Territory government scientists who have recorded the drop have not been able to find out why numbers have fallen, and suspect several causes. The harbour is home to three small, tropical coast-hugging species, some of which are endemic to Northern Australia.

Known locally as a dolphin whisperer, he and generations of locals maintain an unlikely haven for the bottlenose dolphins. It is illegal to feed, touch or impede the dolphins, but many locals have always done so, usually on their return from fishing trips. "They recognise me, I do believe they recognise me. Because I've come down so much I think they've come to recognise me," Mr Burke, 24, said.

It's the first loss of the Trump era. Mexico and the U.S. have fought for years over tuna. The U.S. insists that any Mexican tuna sold in the U.S. must be "dolphin safe," meaning dolphins weren't killed by tuna fisherman, which was once common. Mexico says its fisherman play by the rules. The U.S. government disagrees.

The whale was first seen by ecologist Dave Andrews, who tweeted a video of the mammal swimming in the river off Coalhouse Fort, Essex. "Can't believe I'm writing this, no joke - BELUGA in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort," he tweeted. He added that the whale had been feeding around the barges across the Thames near Gravesend in Kent for around an hour and had not moved more than 200 meters.

"When something turns up on your doorstep, it gives a different immediacy to it," says Samuel Turvey, between glimpses of a spectacle resembling a ghostly, animated inner tube.

For writer Philip Hoare, the grim discovery "vividly illustrated" how the whale had adopted new meaning, within his lifetime alone. "When I was boy, ships were coming up from the Southern Ocean laden with whale blubber, which [was] processed into … the make-up on my mother's face and the strings on my tennis rackets," Hoare says.

Conservationists and animal experts were hopeful the tide would take the rare arctic mammal back out to sea, so it could find its way home. However, those gathered on the banks of the estuary just outside Gravesend reported spotting it around a mile further in than it was yesterday, and it appeared to be swimming further inshore.

Despite a million-pound rescue attempt, that northern bottlenose died of dehydration, unable to feed on her deep-water diet of squid and thus slake her thirst.
