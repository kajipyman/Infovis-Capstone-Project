The Australian central bank kept its cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent, as expected by economists polled by Reuters. The RBA last adjusted rates in August 2016, cutting the cash rate from 1.75 per cent to 1.5 per cent. RBA governor Philip Lowe said that the Australian economy enjoyed strong growth over the past year but noted that US trade policy created an “ongoing uncertainty...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item><item><title>Reserve Bank bounces back into the black with $3.8bn profit - ABC News</title><link>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-20/reserve-bank-back-in-black-with-3.8bn-profit/10287562</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEL5qhn-UYfUwsUv1hSPTM8UqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDM2g4</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2018 11:33:23 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-20/reserve-bank-back-in-black-with-3.8bn-profit/10287562" target="_blank"&gt;Reserve Bank bounces back into the black with $3.8bn profit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has roared back into profitability, with a $3.8 billion profit last year. Key points: - RBA turns 2017 $900m loss into a $3.8b profit this year - RBA has made $30b profit over the past decade, largely on currency transactions - Dividend to the Federal Government down 50pc to $669m this year It represents a $4.7 billion turnaround from last year's $900 million loss. While losses are unusual, they are not unprecedented as the bank plays the long game in currency trading, tending to lean against the market if it thinks the dollar is over, or undervalued at a...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item><item><title>Mortgage cost less than 2017: RBA - The Australian</title><link>https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/cost-of-house-loan-still-less-than-2017-after-recent-rate-rise-rba/news-story/e49bfbad1569105481225ded0d956ee2</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHLL5dZcnwTZN4RL_TITPWkqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowga_TBDDc734w8pLEAQ</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/cost-of-house-loan-still-less-than-2017-after-recent-rate-rise-rba/news-story/e49bfbad1569105481225ded0d956ee2" target="_blank"&gt;Mortgage cost less than 2017: RBA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Australian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank is downplaying risks to the housing market from rising mortgage interest rates, saying yesterday that the cost of funding a home loan is still below that of a year ago. In minutes of its September 4 policy meeting, the RBA said that at the time of the board gathering, lenders accounting for about 40 per cent of the market had raised mortgage lending rates. “These increases would imply a small rise in the average housing loan rate, unwinding about half of the decline observed in the average housing loan rate over the preceding year,” the RBA said.

It would then lead to the unemployment rate rising 0.25 per cent and inflation falling by 0.2 per cent. Those findings appeared in an internal report, prepared by the Reserve Bank in March, released in response to a freedom of information request from Bloomberg. The research was conducted before the Trump administration had decided to exempt Australia from its steel and aluminium tariffs.
