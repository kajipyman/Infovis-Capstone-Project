New South Wales state District Court Judge Roy Ellis upheld former Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson's appeal of his May conviction in a lower court for concealing the sexual abuse of two altar boys by a pedophile priest in the 1970s. Ellis found there was reasonable doubt that the 68-year-old cleric had committed the crime, which is punishable by up to two years in prison.
