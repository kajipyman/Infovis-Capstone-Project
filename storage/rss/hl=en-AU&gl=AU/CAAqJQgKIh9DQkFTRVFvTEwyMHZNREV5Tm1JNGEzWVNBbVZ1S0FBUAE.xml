The upcoming film, "Avengers: Endgame," features Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., Captain America, played by Chris Evans, and Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson. Iron Man is shown floating through space with insufficient oxygen after being left on Titan.

Moments after the trailer went online, the website AvengersEndgame.com went live, with many fans presuming the website would link to more information on the fourth Avengers movie.

Specifically, Avengers 4 — which we now know will be called Avengers: Endgame. The first trailer is finally here and in its first six hours, it’s already clocked up 19 million views on Marvel’s YouTube channel alone. Putting aside the fact that Endgame should be End Game, the name and what’s teased in the trailer confirms what Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige has been saying for a while — this movie, the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe, will mark the end of an era for the MCU.

The two-and-a-half-minute trailer is emotional as hell—which makes sense, given it picks up where Avengers: Infinity War left off. In case you missed it, Thanos, destroyed half of all living things in the universe, including a few of our favorite superheroes.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) The long-awaited Avengers 4 trailer finally dropped this morning, complete with the hitherto secret, supposedly spoiler-ish title, “Endgame.” Hmm. Doesn’t seem like there’s a huge spoiler in there, other than the fact that this film will finally wrap up the MCU plotline that has unfolded over the last decade – but we already knew that. This is a bleak, subdued superhero trailer, opening with Tony Stark lamenting his fate, alone and adri...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>'Avengers: Endgame' Trailer Hints At Major Off-Screen Death - HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/avengers-endgame-trailer-offscreen-death_us_5c0a779be4b0de79357c28ea</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJq4Jy8lUYt13IA5Oj-4qD4qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowxYgCMIBNMKOXAg</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 18:54:06 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/avengers-endgame-trailer-offscreen-death_us_5c0a779be4b0de79357c28ea" target="_blank"&gt;'Avengers: Endgame' Trailer Hints At Major Off-Screen Death&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first promo video for “Avengers: Endgame” (aka “Avengers 4”) is finally here, and the obvious question has presented itself: Wakanda trailer is this? On the surface, the teaser offers a quick summary of where the superhero megafranchise stands after “Infinity War”: Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half the universe, and now it looks like the other half has fallen into a deep depression. Meanwhile, Thanos is just out there farming.

Most importantly, there's a suggestion that there will, indeed, be a way to reverse "the snap" cause by Thanos, in which half of living beings in the universe ceased to exist.

The major bombshell is the movie's name. "Avengers: Endgame" is the big, brassy statement fans will have hoped for (though a few may have been holding out for the other rumoured moniker, Avengers: Annihilation).

Far from the usual formula that saw Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland step into Spider-Man's suit in recent years, Into the Spider-Verse focuses on Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), a teenager of Puerto Rican and African-American descent who turns out to be one of several Spider-Men. Jake Johnson (best known as Nick Miller in New Girl) voices Peter Parker, who in this instance takes on the role of Morales's mentor.
