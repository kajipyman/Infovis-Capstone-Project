Then the trail went cold, and remained that way for 190 years. Now a Canberra researcher has worked out what happened next.

"I used to lay in bed and the door would be ajar and I'd watch him sit there in a blue haze of smoke," Gail says. "He'd tilt his glasses down and he'd look to the door to where I was and sure enough, he'd make a sign for me to go to sleep, but I would just lay there and watch him.

Those that did suggest new statues often put forward strong calls to properly acknowledge Australia’s past including its impressive Indigenous history and its brutal frontier wars.

On this day in 1992, Mr Mabo won a legal challenge to formally recognise the land rights of Indigenous people. Mr Mabo had been fighting for his right to his land for 10 years, but the High Court ruling was handed down five months after he passed away. The ruling ended the doctrine of Terra Nullius. His daughter, Gail Mabo, was in a car with her son and "cried with joy" when she heard the news on the radio in 1992.
