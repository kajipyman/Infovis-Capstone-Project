Newman made headlines in July after making an on-air statement in the direction of Channel Nine, sitting in silence before raising his middle finger to the camera. But this effort on Thursday night’s Footy Show was slightly more political, taking aim at the latest controversy surrounding Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
