The Australian actress married Cruise in 1990, when she was 22, after they starred together in Days Of Thunder. In an essay for New York Magazine Kidman, now 51, said the marriage, which lasted a decade, meant she avoided becoming a victim of harassment. She wrote: "I got married very young, but it definitely wasn't power for me - it was protection. I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed."
