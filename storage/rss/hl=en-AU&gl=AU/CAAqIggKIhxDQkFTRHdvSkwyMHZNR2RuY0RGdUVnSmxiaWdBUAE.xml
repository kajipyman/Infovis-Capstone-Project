The Oscars have a longstanding host problem, but Kevin Hart's swift downfall over old anti-gay tweets has led to bigger questions about the gig and the liability of social media histories. It's just the latest controversy for the organization that puts on the Academy Awards, which is trying to combat declining ratings for its marquee event while weathering the pressure of being a focal point for the shortcomings of the entertainment industry as a whole.

On Thursday (Nov. 6) night, Kevin Hart announced that he was stepping down from his hosting gig at the 2019 Academy Awards, less than two days after he was initially announced.
