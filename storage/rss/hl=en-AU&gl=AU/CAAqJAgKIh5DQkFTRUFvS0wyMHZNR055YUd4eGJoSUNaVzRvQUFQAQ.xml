The defection of Victorian Liberal MP Julia Banks to the crossbench shattered morale last week. Disagreements over policy and political strategy looked set to cripple any prospect of Scott Morrison building momentum before the summer recess. A breakout in factional warring looked imminent. However, by yesterday there were early signs that Morrison was asserting his authority on the government.

He was the most vocal critic of his party's energy policy and has threatened to sit on the crossbench. Who is this man and why was he worth saving? As the head of a local retailers' association, Mr Kelly won preselection for the seat of Hughes in 2010 after the retirement of Donna Vale. After growing the Liberals' winning margin in the seat in 2010, his first speech to Parliament described the challenges of raising a son with Down syndrome.

The ABC understands the NSW state executive will intervene in the preselection for all undecided seats where an incumbent was facing a challenge - something Prime Minister Scott Morrison has requested. This would ensure conservative Liberal MP Craig Kelly would not face a preselection battle, which he was widely expected to lose.

The killing season came prematurely this year, but the atmosphere inside Parliament House is just as febrile. The sense of anarchy and chaos is real in Canberra as the Morrison Government goes to war with itself — unable to put out political fires burning out of control and lurching from one crisis to another.

Mr Turnbull also urged Scott Morrison to go to an early election and avoid the NSW Liberal government being punished by voters because of the federal turmoil gripping the party. The former prime minister has revealed he and Mr Morrison were planning to go to a March 2 election before he was overthrown in August.

It's not that Mr Turnbull's removal from the prime ministership brought with it an end to the Federal Government's stance on asylum seekers. But it did create a political vacuum that ultimately changed the political landscape and fate of these children. This debate isn't new, so why is it changing now?

Mr Turnbull noted Indonesia had “serious concern” about Mr Morrison’s decision to consider moving Australia’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but he believed a trade deal with the country would still go ahead. “There is no question, were that move to occur, it would be met with a very negative reaction in Indonesia.

Her speech at a Women's Weekly forum last week marked the first time Ms Bishop, a party heavyweight, had publicly acknowledged the party's role in the under-representation of women in Australian politics. Women make up 50.7 per cent of the Australian population, yet just under a third of the Federal Parliament. About one in five federal Coalition MPs is female.

The claims have no doubt only further dissuaded more women from entering politics — a blow to a group already grossly underrepresented in parliaments at both a state and federal level.
