The upcoming film, "Avengers: Endgame," features Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., Captain America, played by Chris Evans, and Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson. Iron Man is shown floating through space with insufficient oxygen after being left on Titan.

Specifically, Avengers 4 — which we now know will be called Avengers: Endgame. The first trailer is finally here and in its first six hours, it’s already clocked up 19 million views on Marvel’s YouTube channel alone. Putting aside the fact that Endgame should be End Game, the name and what’s teased in the trailer confirms what Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige has been saying for a while — this movie, the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe, will mark the end of an era for the MCU.

Spoiler warning: big purple bad dude Thanos succeeded in wiping out literally half of the entire universe, including a considerable proportion of the Marvel heroes fans had grown to love over the course of an eventful movie-going decade.

Such is the thrilling trajectory the Marvel Cinematic Universe would seem to be on with release of the cosmically-anticipated first trailer for the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War. The major bombshell is the movie's name. "Avengers: Endgame" is the big, brassy statement fans will have hoped for (though a few may have been holding out for the other rumoured moniker, Avengers: Annihilation).

Marvel released the preview of “Avengers: Endgame” (yep, that’s the title) early Friday, and Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark/Iron Man got things off to a dark start by intoning, “Part of the journey is the end.” The sense of foreboding doesn’t lighten up much from there, as others in the Marvel gang issue ominous proclamations about the battle ahead in the perfect appetite-whetter for the film’s opening on May 3.

And that may not be all: The first trailer for “Spider-Man: Far from Home” is expected to be released on Saturday. After introducing Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, in September, Marvel rolled-out a follow-up explaining that she’s part of the Kree, a race of noble heroes in a seemingly endless war with the evil Skrull empire.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) The second trailer for Captain Marvel showcased just how immensely powerful the Captain is going to be, with her mohawked space scenes looking more Dragon Ball Z than MCU. Most fans seem intrigued to finally see the character on screen, especially after Infinity War hinted that she might be the most important, and powerful, member of the Avengers thus far. But a common complaint keeps popping up on social media – why does Brie Larson, talente...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Two new Marvel trailers reportedly arriving this week - The Telegraph</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2018/12/03/two-new-marvel-trailers-reportedly-arriving-week/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEcnebiptwUClCTdb_PWab0qFwgEKg4IACoGCAowm6R6MMKqCTDf2rcF</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 11:23:02 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2018/12/03/two-new-marvel-trailers-reportedly-arriving-week/" target="_blank"&gt;Two new Marvel trailers reportedly arriving this week&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christmas seems to have come early for Marvel fans with the upcoming release of trailers for the highly anticipated Captain Marvel and Avengers 4. The rumours had been growing over the last few weeks regarding the possibility of both trailers being released, despite Marvel not yet having made an official announcement. However, entertainment pundits such as John Campea and Daniel RPK tweeted on Sunday that Marvel Studios would debut the new trailer for Captain Marvel at halftime during the Monday Night Football matchup.

YouTube It's finally here. On Friday, Marvel released the long-awaited trailer for Avengers 4, a.k.a. Avengers: Endgame. The two-and-a-half-minute trailer is emotional as hell—which makes sense, given it picks up where Avengers: Infinity War left off. In case you missed it, Thanos, destroyed half of all living things in the universe, including a few of our favorite superheroes. In Avengers: Endgame, we'll see the remaining good guys finish their fight against Thanos—and knowing Marvel, it's going to be epic as hell. Avengers: Endgame is slated for an April 2019 release.&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.menshealth.com">Men's Health</source></item><item><title>'Avengers 4' gets a title, trailer and new release date - The Associated Press</title><link>https://apnews.com/aee06530cb554c4cb674441c248090b3</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHdp9VGx2i_RBkYLpF1VvVkqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowhO7OATDh9CgwruxQ</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 16:08:14 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/aee06530cb554c4cb674441c248090b3" target="_blank"&gt;'Avengers 4' gets a title, trailer and new release date&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (AP) — The fourth "Avengers" movie finally has a title. Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Co. said Friday that the highly anticipated, and closely guarded, conclusion to the "Infinity War" saga will be called "Avengers: Endgame." The studios also released the first trailer for the film, in which Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow character explains that Thanos really did erase half the population.
