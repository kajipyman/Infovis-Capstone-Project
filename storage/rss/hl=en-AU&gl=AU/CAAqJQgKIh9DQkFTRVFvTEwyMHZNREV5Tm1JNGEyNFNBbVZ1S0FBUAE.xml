The first trailer is finally here and in its first six hours, it’s already clocked up 19 million views on Marvel’s YouTube channel alone. Putting aside the fact that Endgame should be End Game, the name and what’s teased in the trailer confirms what Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige has been saying for a while — this movie, the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe, will mark the end of an era for the MCU.

Such is the thrilling trajectory the Marvel Cinematic Universe would seem to be on with release of the cosmically-anticipated first trailer for the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War. The major bombshell is the movie's name. "Avengers: Endgame" is the big, brassy statement fans will have hoped for (though a few may have been holding out for the other rumoured moniker, Avengers: Annihilation).

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) The long-awaited Avengers 4 trailer finally dropped this morning, complete with the hitherto secret, supposedly spoiler-ish title, “Endgame.” Hmm. Doesn’t seem like there’s a huge spoiler in there, other than the fact that this film will finally wrap up the MCU plotline that has unfolded over the last decade – but we already knew that.

Shang-Chi will become the studio's first Asian protagonist, with Chinese-American writer Dave Callahan on screenwriting duties. Created by Steven Englehart and Jim Starlin, Shang-Chi made his first appearance in December 1973 following the boom of martial arts films thanks to the success of Enter the Dragon. He’s the son of a China-based globalist who, after being raised in a reclusive compound, developed “unsurpassed skills” in kung fu.

In the comics, the Skrulls are a race of shape-shifting aliens intent on invading Earth, while also being engaged in a prolonged war with fellow extraterrestrials, the Kree. Captain Marvel, born Carol Danvers, is a human whose DNA has become fused with that of a Kree, resulting in her superpowers. The film suggests she doesn't remember her past on Earth. However, she knows a Skrull when she sees one, which explains why the trailers so far have featured Capta...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Brie Larson Gives Chris Hemsworth a Run for His Money With Thor's Hammer - Men's Health</title><link>https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a25304969/brie-larson-chris-hemsworth-thor-hammer/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJQVEcnk545LsgoYZyNSXbMqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowkJcIMIFmMPqVBA</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 15:23:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a25304969/brie-larson-chris-hemsworth-thor-hammer/" target="_blank"&gt;Brie Larson Gives Chris Hemsworth a Run for His Money With Thor's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Men's Health&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Marvel Universe.
