Only those pretending to live in some sort of reality-proof bubble could flippantly discard the acrimonious events that have surrounded the first two Tests in South Africa and expect us to concentrate only on the cricket itself, even as AB de Villiers caressed another sublime cover drive. Sadly, the conflict has not been removed from the contest but ingrained in it.

Lodge revealed his battle with prescription drugs while giving his first insight into the 2015 incident after Brisbane received criticism for throwing the prop an NRL lifeline this year.

Daley said there is no doubt the Brisbane player, who makes his NRL return on Thursday, is trying to atone for his New York rampage two years ago.
