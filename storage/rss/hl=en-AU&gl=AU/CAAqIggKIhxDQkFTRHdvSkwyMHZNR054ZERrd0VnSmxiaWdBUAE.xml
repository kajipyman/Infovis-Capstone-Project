Prosecutors in New York asked a judge to sentence Cohen to a "substantial term of imprisonment" for paying an adult film star hush money on Mr Trump's behalf, and for evading taxes.

Panic spread after someone had sprayed an irritant, local media reported, although this was not confirmed by investigators. However, Italy's Interior minister Matteo Salvini said there possibly was a "stink" that could have been ammonia or another substance. Three girls and two boys aged between 14 and 16 died after panic spread at the club, in Corinaldo, near Ancona, on the central Adriatic coast.

The biggest piece of the shifting picture: Chief of Staff John Kelly's departure now appears certain.

In a sentencing memo filed in the case against Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Mueller notes topics about which Cohen has provided information.

Tillerson, as “dumb as a rock” and “lazy as hell” on Friday after Mr. Tillerson said that the president had regularly pushed him to take actions that were illegal. Mr. Trump, who fired Mr. Tillerson with a Twitter post in March, lashed back at him the same way after the former secretary gave a talk in Houston and said Mr. Trump was undisciplined, did not like to read and did not respect the limits of his office. “Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him,” Mr. Trump wrote on Friday afternoon, referrin...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Trump resort worker: No regrets speaking out about abuse - The Associated Press</title><link>https://www.apnews.com/1569d8ea0e99496fb73b9555e0099b15</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELph0KHH_DKnAXaJZx1JdPEqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowhO7OATDh9Cgwm4pR</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 07:39:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.apnews.com/1569d8ea0e99496fb73b9555e0099b15" target="_blank"&gt;Trump resort worker: No regrets speaking out about abuse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A Guatemalan living in the U.S. illegally who says she faced abusive working conditions as a maid at Donald Trump's New Jersey golf club doesn't regret speaking out, even though she might lose her job and be deported. Victorina Morales told The Associated Press in an interview Friday that she can't go back to Guatemala because her family has received death threats, but that she had to stand up for other workers without legal documents at the club who have been ridiculed by a supervisor as "donkeys" and "dogs."

It wasn't until Wednesday that the world learned that Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, had been arrested on Saturday in Canada at the behest of US authorities.

With that in mind, and contemplating the Democrats’ return to power in the House of Representatives, here’s a little thought experiment. Suppose we did have a parliamentary system. How many political parties would we have? And what can this thought experiment tell us about the nature of our two parties and the dysfunction we see daily?

Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, will make the biggest cut. Russia, which is not an OPEC member but is an increasingly important factor in global oil markets, will account for much of the rest. The agreement on cuts, which were deeper than expected, capped two days of meetings focused on a growing oil glut that had caused prices to drop by roughly a third since ea...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Takeaways from the new Cohen and Manafort filings - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/cohen-manafort-mueller-takeaways/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMu7kj-3hC02Kyspruy6VFAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMJrUpgU</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 06:16:51 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/cohen-manafort-mueller-takeaways/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Takeaways from the new Cohen and Manafort filings&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone's lying to Robert Mueller -- and he knows it. The court filings released Friday by Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors detail the alleged lies Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort told both publicly and to the special counsel's investigators. And for the first time, prosecutors publicly endorsed Cohen's earlier statements in court that he acted at the direction of Trump when he committed two crimes in 2016: making payments to the two women alleging affairs with Trump in order to keep them silent.

Everything else was redacted.

President Trump and his allies have long rallied around the defiant battle cry that special counsel Robert Mueller is conducting a "witch hunt" that has uncovered "no collusion" with Russia. But public filings by Mueller and the Southern District of New York over the past two weeks have changed the game.

Manafort, a longtime Washington operative who chaired the Trump campaign for several months during the 2016 election cycle, was accused by Mueller’s team last month of breaking a plea deal reached in September by lying to investigators. Mueller’s team didn’t specify the lies at the time, writing only that Manafort had committed additi...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item></channel></rss>
