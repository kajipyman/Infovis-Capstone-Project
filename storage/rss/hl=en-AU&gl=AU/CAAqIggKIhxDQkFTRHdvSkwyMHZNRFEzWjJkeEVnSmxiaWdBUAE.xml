As he tells Mark Howard in the latest episode of his podcast series The Howie Games, he was “stone, motherless broke”. “I’d played football and had a pretty good business and had a pretty good life then all of a sudden I had absolutely nothing,” Newman says.

Proving our thirst for Aussie rules knowledge, the story our readers clicked on more than any other in 2016 was a simple, but important one. In March, AFL boss Gillon McLachlan ensured the grand final would start at 2.30pm, quashing the idea of a twilight decider and keeping with tradition. “It was a long discussion and there is an appetite to look at a different start time in future, but on balance the prevailing view is tradition prevailed and it will start at 2.30pm this ye...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.heraldsun.com.au">The Advertiser</source></item><item><title>Rule-makers score an own goal - The Australian</title><link>http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/opinion/patrick-smith/afl-rules-changes-illthought-out-and-rushed-in-regardless/news-story/d0c41b71516fc0b54f0d1ccb156766b3</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELah1biUkxuBOjNOxwXXdQ4qGAgEKg8IACoHCAowga_TBDDc734w44_EAQ</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/opinion/patrick-smith/afl-rules-changes-illthought-out-and-rushed-in-regardless/news-story/d0c41b71516fc0b54f0d1ccb156766b3" target="_blank"&gt;Rule-makers score an own goal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Australian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would need to be done in the dark.
