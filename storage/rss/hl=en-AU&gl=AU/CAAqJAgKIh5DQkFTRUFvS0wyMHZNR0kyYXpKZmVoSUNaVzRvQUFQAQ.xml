The 47-year-old founder of WikiLeaks moved into the Ecuadorian Embassy in central London in 2012 while wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden. Assange maintained his innocence and claimed the charges were nothing more than an attempt to extradite him to the United States.

Manafort called the Guardian’s report “100% false.” The reporting on the 2016 meeting is based on a single “well-placed source,” but the ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://qz.com">Quartz</source></item><item><title>Lewandowski calls on Mueller report to be made public when released - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/politics/corey-lewandowski-mueller-report-roger-stone-cnntv/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENjunBGH-qttYgB4-gfb5HUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMJrUpgU</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 13:48:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/politics/corey-lewandowski-mueller-report-roger-stone-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lewandowski calls on Mueller report to be made public when released&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski called for the special counsel's report to be released to the American public when Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation.
