Enterprise zips back and forth across the universe, propelled by a “warp drive.” Sadly for fans of space travel, that would seem to run counter to Einstein’s equations, which generally prohibit faster-than-light journeys. But with the hypothetical addition “exotic matter,” this sci-fi invention actually fits within the confines of Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which describes gravity and the bending of space-time by matter.

But lately he has been dying a second death, if one believes a new spate of articles and papers bemoaning the state of contemporary physics. Never mind the recent, staggering discovery of gravitational waves: ripples in space-time that Einstein predicted a century ago, and which indicate the universe is peppered with black holes that shred and swallow stars.

For the last two decades, two rival teams of astronomers, looking to test some of Albert Einstein’s weirdest predictions about the universe, have aimed their telescopes at the star, which lies 26,000 light-years away.

One of the most puzzling and counterintuitive aspects of quantum physics is the apparent link between determinism and measurement. Make a precise measurement of the quantum state of your particle — of its spin, its position, or which slit it went through — and you determine that property exactly. Choose not to make that measurement, and that property is ind...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Mathematicians must be more prepared to test their truths - New Scientist News</title><link>https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23931972-900-mathematicians-must-be-more-prepared-to-test-their-truths/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHwjeM3Guy8-SGK8MryaD3gqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowyseYCTDXhmww8pwn</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23931972-900-mathematicians-must-be-more-prepared-to-test-their-truths/" target="_blank"&gt;Mathematicians must be more prepared to test their truths&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;New Scientist News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT IS a truism that science is not true.
