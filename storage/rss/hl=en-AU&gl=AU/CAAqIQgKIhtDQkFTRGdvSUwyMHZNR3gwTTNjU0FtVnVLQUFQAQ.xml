Soon after, she was stopping crowds on Bourke Street, many surprised to see only one person making the music. Sultana taught herself how to play about 10 instruments including guitar, percussion and piano, as well as saxophone, Arabic oud, and American pan pipes. She plays solo, looping and layering her sounds.

The latest organisation to explore the issue is ABC youth radio station Triple J, which is considering moving the date of its Australia Day Hottest 100 countdown. The countdown has been part of Australia Day for years. Interestingly, January 26 only became a national holiday in 1994 — which makes it younger than the Hottest 100.

The sky's the limit for Yolngu rapper Baker Boy, who has had a year beyond his wildest dreams — with two songs cracking into triple j's Hottest 100. Danzel Baker, aka Baker Boy, 21, burst onto the music scene in May with his first single, Cloud 9, which hit 76 in the Hottest 100. His follow-up track, Marryuna, reached 17. Born and raised in the remote Top End communities of Milingimbi and Maningrida, the now Melbourne-based Baker Boy takes his name from the dance duo formed by both his father and uncle Jeremiah in the 1980s, The Baker Boys. His uncle Jeremiah said Danz...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item><item><title>The one Hottest 100 classic you'll never hear on the radio - ABC News</title><link>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-26/hottest-100-the-classic-you-wont-hear-on-the-radio/9356100</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEBSm09sAtEiJvrGT6y8A9soqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDc2g4</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 19:04:28 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-26/hottest-100-the-classic-you-wont-hear-on-the-radio/9356100" target="_blank"&gt;The one Hottest 100 classic you'll never hear on the radio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the history of the Hottest 100, 1997 was a memorable year. Australian band The Whitlams took out the top spot with No Aphrodisiac, a slinky piano ballad. The deeply divisive Tubthumping by Chumbawamba ("I get knocked down, but I get up again …") came in at number three, while Radiohead had two tracks from their career-defining OK Computer in the top 10.

In recent years, the network has come under pressure to move the Hottest 100 after criticism from Indigenous communities and organisations that holding the show on ‘Invasion Day’ is insensitive and inflammatory. A review was launched following last year’s Hottest 100 involving Indigenous groups and the ABC’s Bonner Committee – the organisation’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues advisory panel – which was followed by a listener survey.

Speaking on the red carpet at Tuesday night’s Aria awards, Briggs, of AB Original, said the decision reflected “how the majority of people feel” and was a welcome “step towards equity and inclusivity”. “It’s a dumb day, it’s stupid.

The scheduling change was announced yesterday and has caused significant brouhaha among politicians, with some criticising the ABC for seeking to "delegitimise" Australia Day. Triple j management argue the Hottest 100 was not created as an Australia Day celebration, and it had consulted with its audience, the music industry and Indigenous Australians about whether changing the date was necessary.
