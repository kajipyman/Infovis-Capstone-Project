For instance, PETA suggests saying “feed two birds with one scone” instead of “kill two birds with one stone” and “feed a fed horse” rather than “beat a dead horse.” You can see other examples below: Words matter, and as our understanding of social justice evolves, our language evolves along with it.

PETA wants the town of Issigeac in Dordogne – a province famous for duck confit and foie gras – to change the street name from ‘Rue de la Saucisse,’ which translates to ‘Sausage Street’ in English. The group has officially requested that the town’s mayor steps in and renames it ‘Rue de la Soycisse’ after soy, a common ingredient in vegan meals. Unfortunately for PETA, the request has already been poo-pooed...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.rt.com">RT</source></item><item><title>PETA Asks a Village Named Wool to Change Its Name to Vegan Wool - The New York Times</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/europe/uk-peta-wool-village.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENPOZyrsrnkbNeiE3e6VBC0qFwgEKg8IACoHCAowjuuKAzCWrzww5oEY</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 20:54:28 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/europe/uk-peta-wool-village.html" target="_blank"&gt;PETA Asks a Village Named Wool to Change Its Name to Vegan Wool&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON — It began, PETA says, as a playful attempt to draw attention to animal cruelty in the wool industry: The animal rights group sent a letter asking the English village of Wool to change its name to Vegan Wool. But the letter from the British branch of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, received on Wednesday by village officials, attracted scorn and ridicule from residents of Wool after it was posted on Facebook by the local parish council clerk, according to news reports. “With a simple name change, your village can take a stand against this cruelty,” Elisa Allen, director o...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>How hapless Wool got blanketed by Peta's shock publicity - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/23/how-hapless-wool-got-blanketed-by-petas-shock-publicity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHe7h0SIK8FBU4IJzdrScCMqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDlkko</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 19:01:54 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/23/how-hapless-wool-got-blanketed-by-petas-shock-publicity" target="_blank"&gt;How hapless Wool got blanketed by Peta's shock publicity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until this week the main claim to fame of the quiet Dorset village of Wool, complete with thatched cottages and an Elizabethan bridge, was its status as the setting for key scenes in the novel Tess of the d’Urbervilles by local author Thomas Hardy. This changed on Monday when the parish council received a letter making an offer: if they would rename the village as Vegan Wool, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) would send 2,000 “cruelty-free” fake wool blankets to residents.

In what will surely go down as one of the great campaigns of our age, they have demanded that the village is renamed Vegan Wool, forcing the local parish council to debate the issue.

Well, vegan wool is one of a number of plant-derived textiles that attempt to replicate the softness and insulating properties of animal fibre. That figures.

Since celebrities can’t just be a thing without being “the most beautiful” or “sexiest” version of said thing, PETA has released its annual “Sexiest Vegan” title for 2017. And this year, it’s an-woman, three-way tie for the top spot. The three lucky meat-and-dairy-free ladies are Ruby Rose: Jenna Dewan Tatum: And Maggie Q: The activist group has typically named one man and one woman as its sexiest vegetable-lover of a given year. Last year, for example, Liam Hemsworth and Jhene Aiko took the top spots for sexiest vegetarians.

From likening rape survivors to pigs and cows, to calling Pokémon a form of animal cruelty, PETA's efforts to “save the animals” always make the headlines—and with good reason: they're completely absurd. The animal rights group today released a new video to cry over milk, equating the nutritious drink with Nazism.
