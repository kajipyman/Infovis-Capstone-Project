So the stage was set for the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to deliver a knockout blow. But when he rose to address a rowdy Parliament chamber on Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party, ignored the chaos over Europe, instead using his allotted questions to focus on poverty and welfare changes.

His government has backpedalled on fuel tax increases. Yet the violence threatens Mr Macron’s attempt to brand France as a home for financial services and tech companies.
