Burgess has fallen hard since establishing himself as one of the game’s best big men during the Bunnies’ drive to the 2014 title.

Burgess struggled for impact last year as a result of hip and groin injuries but declared himself problem-free heading into 2017.

For South Sydney rugby league forward, Angus Crichton, it meant giving up a digit. Crichton had his finger amputated after suffering a ruptured tendon that refused to heal. Just six months later he made his Origin debut for New South Wales against Queensland in front of a packed MCG. "[It's] pretty full on stuff but I'm pretty stoked with the decision I've made," he told 7.30. 'Oh, I've actually cut my finger off. It can freak you out' He may never have played Origin if he hadn't had his finger amputated.
