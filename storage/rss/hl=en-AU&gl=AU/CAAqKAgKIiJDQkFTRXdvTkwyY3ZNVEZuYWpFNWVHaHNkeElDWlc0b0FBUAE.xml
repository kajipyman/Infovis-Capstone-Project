Mr Guy's resignation was widely expected by his colleagues after the Liberals saw a swing of about 6 per cent swing against them.

With almost 90 per cent of the vote counted by Wednesday night, Labor's John Kennedy was in the lead with 50.1 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. Mr Pesutto will contest the Liberal leadership if he survives the count, following Matthew Guy's resignation.
