In 2018, across all Australian companies, women account for 50 per cent of heads of legal functions, up from 42 per cent in 2015 and 38 per cent in 2012. While these numbers are heartening, unfortunately, remuneration remains an issue. The recent compensation survey by the Association of Corporate Counsel shows a significant gap in the remuneration of the most senior male and female in-house lawyers with women paid on average 69 per cent of incomes of their male counterpar...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theaustralian.com.au">The Australian</source></item><item><title>Judges’ age of retirement to lift - The Australian</title><link>https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/nsw-to-lift-age-of-retirement-for-judges/news-story/994ee7d288a26112e4e1a95e002c693d</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEF92ub6fQ9Udt3VUW7LO2IYqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowga_TBDDc734wmZ-xAQ</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2018 04:05:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/nsw-to-lift-age-of-retirement-for-judges/news-story/994ee7d288a26112e4e1a95e002c693d" target="_blank"&gt;Judges’ age of retirement to lift&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Australian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSW will forge ahead of other states by lifting the retirement age of judges from 72 to 75 and tightening access to the judicial pension, to keep skilled adjudicators on the bench for longer and deliver taxpayer savings.
