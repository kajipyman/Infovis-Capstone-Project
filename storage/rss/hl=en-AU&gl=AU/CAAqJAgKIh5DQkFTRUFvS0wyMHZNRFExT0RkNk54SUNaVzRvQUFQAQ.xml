Mr Weatherill even presented a commemorative mug of the press conference to the householder Geoff Perkins.

In the months before the vote, it was assumed it would be a contest between the ruling state Labor Party, which has held government for the last 16 years, and the Liberal opposition, which famously lost an unlosable election in 2014 when it won the popular ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item><item><title>Racetrack and training funding the focus of promises on last campaign weekend - ABC News</title><link>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-11/labor-promises-training-tafe-sa-funding-boost-sa-election/9536664</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEIlM8s48OPOle9NinX4u4Q0qFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDtiw4</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 02:07:18 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-11/labor-promises-training-tafe-sa-funding-boost-sa-election/9536664" target="_blank"&gt;Racetrack and training funding the focus of promises on last campaign weekend&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill is promising a $100 million funding boost for vocational educational training if the Labor Government is re-elected next Saturday.
