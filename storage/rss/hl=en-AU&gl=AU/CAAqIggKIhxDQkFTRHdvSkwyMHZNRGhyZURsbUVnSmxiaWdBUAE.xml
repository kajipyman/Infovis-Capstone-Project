But some residents are already sceptical of the plan, which will create a 10-kilometre bus lane from the Ellenbrook town centre to Marshall Road. The $55 million rapid transit bus is the latest iteration in a succession of promised public transport solutions for the suburb of more than 40,000 people.

Teancum Vernon Petersen-Crofts was charged after the woman and her son were found dead and her daughter was found critically injured at a house in Ellenbrook, about 30 kilometres north-east of the city centre, in the early hours of Sunday morning. The teenage girl was taken to hospital but died on the way.

"You get a situation where you're amongst cattle and those cattle aren't going to be travelling," businessman Willy Packer, a prominent figure in the behind-the-scenes operations of the Liberal Party, said of the 71-kilometre route. It was a common refrain from members of the Liberal Party of the time, with one frontbencher saying the Labor government should "can the whole bloody project" and ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item><item><title>Extreme downsizing: Could you live on a block the size of an AFL goal square? - ABC News</title><link>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-11/micro-lots-developers-entice-buyers-to-tiny-houses-in-ellenbrook/9637268</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELKNuuO6yv4rgFWpk56Hn1wqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDtiw4</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 02:59:55 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-11/micro-lots-developers-entice-buyers-to-tiny-houses-in-ellenbrook/9637268" target="_blank"&gt;Extreme downsizing: Could you live on a block the size of an AFL goal square?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you live on a block that's smaller than three shipping containers put together? Or a block just slightly bigger than an AFL goal square? That is the question facing Perth home buyers, with the launch of the first "micro lot" housing project in Western Australia. Built in Ellenbrook in Perth's north-east — a traditional first-home-buyer suburb where land is relatively cheap — the lots are just 80 square metres in size. To get a sense of how small that is, a traditional quarter-acre block — which converts to 1012 square metres — would fit 12 micro lots inside, with room to spare.

The ABC understands Mr Shorten will promise that if Labor wins the next federal election, there will be a large injection of Commonwealth funds for Ellenbrook — part of the McGowan Government's signature Metronet election promise. In August, Mr Shorten used Labor's state conference in Perth to pledge the creation of a $1.6 billion infrastructure fund to partially offset WA's massive shortfall in GST revenue.

It was a sentiment highlighted in recent days when Dr Nahan said the Government should plug a $400 million budget black hole by dumping some sections of the Metronet rail project — Labor's signature election promise. The Liberals created the hole when they killed off the Government's proposed gold royalty increase by supporting a disallowance motion in the Upper House.

Earlier this week the Liberals decided to block the Government's proposed gold royalty hike, leaving it dead in the water without the Nationals or crossbench support. It leaves the McGowan Government scrambling to fill a $400 million hole in the state's budget. Dr Nahan suggested the Government scrap parts of its flagship transport plan, Metronet.

The media event with WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti and Federal Social Services Minister Christian Porter quickly descended into tit-for-tat, as the two criticised each other over public transport funding despite standing right beside each other. The press conference drew comparisons to an infamous media event earlier this year, in which South Australian Pr...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item></channel></rss>
