No tsunami arrived and there were no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries. The US Geological Survey said the first and more powerful quake was centred about 12 kilometres north of Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city, with a population of about 300,000. People ran from their offices or took cover under desks.

On 11 November, something stirred near the French island of Mayotte off the west coast of Madagascar and sent a rumble around the world. Travelling at 9,000mph, the deep hum hurtled past earthquake detection systems unnoticed. No one appears to have felt a thing. The event came to light on Twitter when seismology enthusiasts posted weird signals they had spotted in recordings made by seismic stations from Kenya to Hawaii. Having ruled out the violent lurches of an earthquake, educated guesses gave way to more fanciful theories.

Here's why&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska is no stranger to earthquakes. In fact, it's the most seismically-active state in the US, experts say. The state also experienced the second-largest earthquake to ever hit the US -- a 9.2-magnitude in 1964. Friday's 7.0 magnitude earthquake near Anchorage is no surprise to experts. The state is located along the Pacific "Ring of Fire" and joins the Pacific and North American plates. The area is marked by subduction zones, where two of the Earth's tectonic plates meet, according to Randy Baldwin, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey.

Still, hundreds of aftershocks frayed nerves Saturday as people worried about being caught in more massive shakers. “They’re disturbing, and I’m not putting anything away that could fall until they calm down,” Randall Cavanaugh, an Anchorage attorney, said following a restless night at home. “I kept waking up.” Employees who live in communities north of Anchorage have been encouraged to see if they can t...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.voanews.com">VOA News</source></item><item><title>6.0-magnitude earthquake strikes off Colombia coast - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/25/americas/colombia-earthquake-6-0/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPLRQZG4WdnvEcN2000ixKAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMPvTpgU</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 05:58:13 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/25/americas/colombia-earthquake-6-0/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;6.0-magnitude earthquake strikes off Colombia coast&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Colombia on Saturday, according to a preliminary report from the US Geological Survey. The quake struck in the Caribbean Sea near the island of Providencia and about 19.9 miles (32 kilometers) from Mountain, Colombia, according to the USGS. The USGS also said the earthquake had a depth of 6.2 miles (10 kilometers). Earthquakes can occur anywhere from zero to 487 miles (800 kilometers) below the earth's surface, according to USGS. The National Tsunami Warning Center said the earthquake is currently not expected to generate a tsunami and ther...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item></channel></rss>
