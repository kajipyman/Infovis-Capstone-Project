Dr Hemmerling, 72, was sent home to Stirling on full pay from his $366,287-a-year chief executive role almost a month ago over claims of serious and wilful misconduct.

Playford Council recorded 6640 cases of illegal dumping last financial year, up by 17 per cent on the previous year’s figure of 5529. While the figures are lower in Salisbury, the amount of recorded cases have nearly doubled in the same time frame, from 250 to 419.
