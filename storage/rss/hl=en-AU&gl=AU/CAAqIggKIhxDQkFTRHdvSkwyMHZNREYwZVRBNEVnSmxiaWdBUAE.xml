Nauert, whose nomination requires U.S. Senate confirmation, is a former Fox News Channel correspondent.

AFP/Getty Images UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday rejected a U.S. resolution condemning Hamas as a terrorist organization, delivering a blow to Ambassador Nikki Haley’s parting action before leaving her post at the end of the year. The vote was the first time that the General Assembly was considering a resolution regarding Hamas, the Palestinian movement controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007.
