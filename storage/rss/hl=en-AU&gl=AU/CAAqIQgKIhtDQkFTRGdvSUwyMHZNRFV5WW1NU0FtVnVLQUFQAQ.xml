Vet Stephen Reinisch told The Age that the critter likely fell off her mother’s back.

In 2016, there were almost 45 million kangaroos in Australia, compared to about 27 million in 2010. It’s understood the huge rise in numbers in recent years is mainly due to environmental conditions; high rainfall has resulted in more food. Experts are now encouraging people to hunt the Australian native animal and eat more kangaroo meat. According to a report published by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, kangaroos are seen as national pests.
