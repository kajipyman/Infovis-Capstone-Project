A new forecast report by Experian, the credit and identity theft protection firm, predicts that video-game data breaches will be a major issue in 2019.

Fortnite: Battle Royale got a huge update, as it always does at the start of the season, but the biggest update to the wider Fortnite property is Creative Mode, a third mode for the game to stand alongside Save the World and Battle Royale. That top-level billing should give you a sense of how important this is to the game and its developer. So what is it?
