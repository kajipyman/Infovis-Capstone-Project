The brutal season is a marathon and many storylines are yet playout but let’s look at the eight things we have learnt so far in 2017. 1 Only three teams can win the premiership flag. Adelaide are the most lethal side in the competition, but have they peaked too early? They are stingy in defence, move the ball faster than any other side and are potent when going inside 50. They should finish in the top ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au">The Advertiser</source></item><item><title>If the AFL is a 'leading' anti-racist organisation, why won't it address the racism I faced? - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/if-the-afl-is-a-leading-anti-racist-organisation-why-wont-it-address-the-racism-i-faced</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPX38Rjj13a0GiaDkGb_FzAqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTC9vBU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 01:50:47 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/if-the-afl-is-a-leading-anti-racist-organisation-why-wont-it-address-the-racism-i-faced" target="_blank"&gt;If the AFL is a 'leading' anti-racist organisation, why won't it address the racism I faced?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved playing football. I gave 12 years of my life to playing the game professionally. But those years were also marked by the pain of being trapped in a culture that condoned racism through a combination of ignorance, habit, and arrogance. In the end, the message to a young, black man like me was clear: I was only of value if I didn’t challenge the status quo. In the past few weeks, I have re-lived the events that marked my final years of football.

The hard thing is keeping the weight off once you go back to normal eating.

That is why I was surprised to see Collingwood president and TV and radio presenter Eddie McGuire openly discuss his extreme weight-loss methods.
