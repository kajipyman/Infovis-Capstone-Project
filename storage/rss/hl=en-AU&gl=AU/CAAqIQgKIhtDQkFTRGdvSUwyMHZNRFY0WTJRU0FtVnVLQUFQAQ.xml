Let's take a closer look at this latest development. Cohen says the reason he lied was to be consistent with Mr Trump's "political messaging".

That’s the takeaway from the Supreme Court’s compromise decision Monday night to allow the questioning of two Justice Department officials regarding a controversial proposed change to the U.S. Census – but not the man ultimately responsible for it, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. The action is part of one of six lawsuits brewing about the change, which would ask census respondents if they are U.S. citizens or not.

Do we have some news for you! Kavanaugh lied throughout his confirmation hearing. He told big lies and easily disprovable small lies.

It’s probably not perjury. Senate Democrats obviously don’t care much for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who stands poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, limit affirmative action, weaken environmental regulations, and otherwise undermine liberal priorities once confirmed. But as his confirmation hearings progress and more documents from his time serving in the Bush White House emerge, Senate Democrats are now leveling a more serious charge: perjury.
