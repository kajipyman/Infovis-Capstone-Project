As I mentioned in my last column, a large number of people and applications can have access to data in a company, and every one of them needs to have the same high level of security control and monitoring.

While nothing is 100% secure, blockchain is designed to be immutable, tamper-proof and democratic. It achieves this, more or less, through three defining characteristics: 1. Decentralization 2. Cryptography 3. Consensus The complex interplay of these characteristics are what secure blockchain transactions and discourage foul play. For the purposes of this article, we’ll look at the first and most well-known blockchain of them all: Bitcoin.

Photographer: Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg California, the home of Silicon Valley and its commodious network of both start-up and multinational technology companies, has long been considered one of the global cradles of innovation. Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are just three of the world’s most powerful companies who call the state home, with Silicon Valley alone thought to possess companies worth almost $3 trillion. The sheer volume of innovation produced by even early-stage start-ups situated in the Valley ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Fighting back on digital data rights - The Australian</title><link>https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/fighting-back-on-digital-data-rights/news-story/34615476134fd4c7c0f424e66dadeaff</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEF9B5bFEbxpHhKaoHbIt3e0qGAgEKg8IACoHCAowga_TBDDc734w4pLEAQ</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/fighting-back-on-digital-data-rights/news-story/34615476134fd4c7c0f424e66dadeaff" target="_blank"&gt;Fighting back on digital data rights&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Australian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Events like the GFC seem inevitable when looking back at the evidence that contributed. And I suspect in a few years we’ll look back on 2018 as the year that shifted our view on consumer data. Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica revelations are largely to thank. The fallout opened up many questions about how our data is stored but also harvested online. Encryption is like any relationship. If it’s only one-sided, it’s bound to fall apart. Australians spent more time online in the past 12 months than they did at work.

Australia in August proposed fines of up to A$10 million ($7.2 million) for institutions and prison terms for individuals who do not comply with a court request to give authorities access to private data. The government has said the proposed law is needed amid a heightened risk of terror attacks.
