The Panthers must now win five of their last eight to be any hope of making the top eight after bouncing back from their flogging at the hands of South Sydney last week. The game was tinged with controversy, with questioning of Dallin Watene-Zelezniak’s 37th minute four-pointer in which he pulled the ball from the grasp of teammate Waqa Blake and appeared to lose possession.

Just two minutes into their 35-10 loss to the Dragons, Matthew Wright fielded a grubber near his goalline and took the tackle. It seemed a routine moment that happens any number of times in a rugby league game, but when Wright got up to play the ball, there was no-one there, resulting in an embarrassing try.

Hopefully for our sake though, this ‘inferior quality’ rubbish is just plain wrong. By way of qualification, any player priced below $200,000 falls into this bracket. The way to all SuperCoaches’ hearts is earning us big cash, or scoring huge points. As such, the ultimate combination we look for come the first Team List Tuesday (TLT) is rookie priced players who can tick both boxes! But ust because a cheapie is named, doesn’t make them a good pick for your SuperCoach team.

Manly’s 35-18 flogging of defending premiers Cronulla on Sunday was the fifth time they have scored 30 or more this season.
