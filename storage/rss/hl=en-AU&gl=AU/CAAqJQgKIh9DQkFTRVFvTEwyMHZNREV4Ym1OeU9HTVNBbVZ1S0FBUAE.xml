In response, "Macron, resign!" has become the main slogan of the "yellow vest" demonstrators.

People had begun gathering early Saturday morning around the Arc de Triomphe, which was damaged in rioting a week ago. Protesters began marching down the Champs-Élysées in central Paris. They were surrounded by exceptionally tight police security, as the government had warned of the potential for new violence.

The president's arrogance could be making matters worse, experts say. Chants of 'Macron resign!' have become common among yellow-clad protesters opposing the French President's pro-business reforms – but the man at the center of the people's grievances is nowhere to be seen.

The worst riots in Paris in decades were sparked by higher fuel taxes, and French President Emmanuel Macron responded by scrapping them Wednesday. But taxes on fossil fuels are just what international climate negotiators, meeting in Poland this week, say are desperately needed to help wean the world off of fossil fuels and slow climate change. “The events of the last few days in Paris have made me regard the challenges as even greater than I thought earlier,” said Stanford University environmental economist Lawrence Goulder,...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.voanews.com">VOA News</source></item><item><title>The Latest: 'Yellow vest' members meet with French PM - The Associated Press</title><link>https://www.apnews.com/0cad5d5fff634699b700f871194a96bc</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEAAq0nh1OGjhnzVs3TJ36ncqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowhO7OATDh9CgwvaadAg</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 23:06:57 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.apnews.com/0cad5d5fff634699b700f871194a96bc" target="_blank"&gt;The Latest: 'Yellow vest' members meet with French PM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS (AP) — The Latest on the protests in France (all times local): 11:50 p.m. Seven members of the "yellow vest" movement say they are satisfied after their meeting with French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on the eve of anti-government protests that authorities fear could turn violent. One of the participants to the meeting, Christophe Chalancon, told reporters the delegation of protesters called for measures aimed at improving the workers' salaries and the purchasing power of the French.

The Franco-German engine has struck again and this time it’s ruffled some feathers. In a last-ditch attempt to strike a deal on an EU-wide tech tax for Emmanuel Macron, Paris and Berlin’s finance ministries have hatched an eleventh hour version of a “digital services tax” that dials down the ambition but will ramp up the pressure on resisters to finally swallow the idea. The FT on Monday night reported on a sparse one-page Franco-German plan that will be sent round to EU finance ministers this Tuesday morning whe...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</source></item><item><title>The Latest: Paris police turn away protesters, seize goggles - The Associated Press</title><link>https://apnews.com/ef1707ec02684d15acdb79c29f949200</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEA8M4XE9WcjpNrKk9osMIqMqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowhO7OATDh9Cgwu4lR</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 10:59:36 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/ef1707ec02684d15acdb79c29f949200" target="_blank"&gt;The Latest: Paris police turn away protesters, seize goggles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS (AP) — The Latest on anti-government protests in France and neighboring countries (all times local): 11:55 a.m. Police are seizing protective equipment from journalists and barring some provincial "yellow vest" protesters from boarding trains to Paris, as part of exceptionally stringent security measures to prevent a repeat of last week's rioting. A group of four protesters who came to Paris from Normandy on Saturday told The Associated Press that they saw people wearing yellow vests turned away at train stations all along their route.

The protesters are railing against fuel price hikes but also against the cancellation of the wealth tax, a decision that was made by French President Emmanuel Macron at the start of his five-year mandate and earned him the nickname "president of the rich". In a radio interview on RTL, Griveaux said for the first time that the government could make a dramatic about-face on th...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.ansamed.info">Agenzia ANSA</source></item></channel></rss>
