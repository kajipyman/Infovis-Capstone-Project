With that in mind, there is at least one clear message that we can divine from the past year in all things Oscar: 2018 has been an absolute mess.

The Oscars have a longstanding host problem, but Kevin Hart's swift downfall over old anti-gay tweets has led to bigger questions about the gig and the liability of social media histories. It's just the latest controversy for the organization that puts on the Academy Awards, which is trying to combat declining ratings for its marquee event while weathering the pressure of being a focal point for the shortcomings of the entertainment industry as a whole.

"When collective hate organizes and gets industrialized, then genocide follows. We have to take it more seriously today than I think we have had to take it in a generation."

Hart, who starred in 'Ride Along' and 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle', said he stepped down because he did not want to be a distraction during the event and that he apologised to the LGBTQ community.
