He was born into a political family, his father George was a long-time Labor MLC. The younger Weatherill went to Henley High School, in the same crop as John Rau who went on to become his deputy, and Paul Caica who also served in Mr Weatherill's cabinet. A career in the law beckoned for Mr Weatherill, and then preselection for the seat of Cheltenham in Adelaide's Western suburbs — solid Labor territory.

The finer points of history — that most governments start out pretty wobbly, hit a sweet spot then head for a gradual decline to political and/or policy ordinariness and eventual defeat — can be lost or forgotten. The striking thing about the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison Government that has technically been in government — though not always able to govern itself let alone the rest of us — since 2013 is that it is hard to say exactly where its sweet spot was.
