In court filings that revealed details of how Michael Cohen has helped the Russia investigation, prosecutors also detailed a previously unknown attempt by a Russian to help the Trump campaign. Prosecutors in New York asked a judge to sentence Cohen to a "substantial term of imprisonment" for paying an adult film star hush money on Mr Trump's behalf, and for evading taxes. Cohen pleaded guilty to the charges in August.

President Trump and his allies have long rallied around the defiant battle cry that special counsel Robert Mueller is conducting a "witch hunt" that has uncovered "no collusion" with Russia. But public filings by Mueller and the Southern District of New York over the past two weeks have changed the game.
