As former deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop — who as a backbencher has become very forthright — said in the Coalition party room on Tuesday, "this is not orthodox Liberal policy".

Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers have teamed up to legislate faster medical treatment for refugees in offshore processing. The Government is strongly opposed to it but there is a chance the bill has enough support to pass the Lower House. "This is about Australia's safety," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.

Ms Merkel was not alone in her bewilderment. Her G20 counterparts were also struggling to keep up with the brutal “revolving door” leadership culture that characterises recent politics Down Under, where there have been five prime ministers in five years. Donald Trump was more direct when he met Mr Morrison, who replaced Malcolm Turnbull following a leadership coup in August.
