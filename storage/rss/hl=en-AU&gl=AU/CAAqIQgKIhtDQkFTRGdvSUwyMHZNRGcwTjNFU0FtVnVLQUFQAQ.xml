He was the first person in Australia to implode a building by rigging it with explosives. "The energy that hits you when it's happening is beyond description," Mr Moltoni said. "There's air shock for a start — it hits you in the chest. "It's quite an emotional thing, it's a draining emotion. "It's far quicker than you might imagine — if you're not looking you've missed it."
