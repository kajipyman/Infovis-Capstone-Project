Amid high inflation (6% as of November), many people expect the pending Rice Tariffication Bill to be a source of quick relief. Some government economists estimated that the law, once passed, might slash the price of rice by as much as P7 per kilo, thus tempering runaway inflation. By allowing freer importation of rice, economists also expect the law to allow Filipinos to enjoy somewhat the ridiculously low rice prices in countries like Thailand in Viet Nam (see Figure 1).

In a joint statement, the National Economic and Development Authority, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Department of Finance said inflation eased to 6% in November due to the improvement in the supply of key agricultural goods such as rice, fish, meat, and vegetables.
