Earlier this month soldiers showed up at shelters in the Hakimpara camp in Cox's Bazar to pressure people into signing up for the ID cards. They began shoving people and telling them to assemble at a nearby security post, a witness told Al Jazeera. Many of the Rohingya assumed the soldiers were there to put them on a list to be sent back to Myanmar and ran away.
