On Wednesday, December 5, inside a Smart Araneta Coliseum that hosted close to 24,000 people who were seeking their own rush, a basketball game took place. But it was more than just a game. It was a battle between two teams who are used to being on the opposite ends of the totem pole: Ateneo, the always favore..."
