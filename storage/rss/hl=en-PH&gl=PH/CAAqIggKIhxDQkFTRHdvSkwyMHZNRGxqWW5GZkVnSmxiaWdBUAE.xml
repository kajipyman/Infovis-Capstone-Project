Senate Majority Leader Miguel Zubiri explained that the Senate has to discuss the 2019 budget in November and December before it goes on a month-long Christmas break.

"The draft will just serve as a reference,” Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon told reporters Thursday.

From extrajudicial killings – the first major issue that rocked his administration – to corruption allegations, martial law, and now the policy toward China, the Senate either cleared the President and some of his allies from liability or has taken a soft stance on the issues.
