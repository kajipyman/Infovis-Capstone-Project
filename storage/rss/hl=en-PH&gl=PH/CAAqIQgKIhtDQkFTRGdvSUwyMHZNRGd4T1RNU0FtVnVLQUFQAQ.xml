Putin’s personal life has unraveled — just a little — with an interview broadcast on state television with a woman who has been described as his daughter. The interview suggested some softening of Mr. Putin’s steely image and the prospect that his two adult daughters may be easing into public life. Russia has no enduring tradition of a public first family, and Soviet and post-Soviet leaders have taken various approaches. Mr. Putin, a former spy, has mostly kept his daughters out of sight.

In the endless speculation about the direction of the investigation, a common view was that maybe the investigation would never implicate President Trump or find any collusion.
