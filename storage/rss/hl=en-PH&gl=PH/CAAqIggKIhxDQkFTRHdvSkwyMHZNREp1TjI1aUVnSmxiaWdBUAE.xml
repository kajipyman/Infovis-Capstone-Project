Strong inflows followed and helped transform the Chinese economy. But these are now starting to be eclipsed by a newer font of capital that is surging into the country’s financial markets. The shift in focus from direct investment into factories and offices towards portfolio flows into stocks and bonds reveals much about how China is changing — and how it is starting to exert greater influence over the world’s financial system.

While overall Chinese investment in the US has dramatically decreased because of scrutiny from regulators, small non-controlling investments have not faced national security reviews and have grown at a record pace.
