Slissie, £19.99. Battery-operated atomiser and mouthpiece. Liquid food essence in cartridges is heated until aromatic, then partially inhaled. Why? If you can’t smoke a bowl, smoke a banana. Well? I wanted an e-cigarette as soon as I saw one. I was intrigued by the flashy lights, but as I was never a smoker to begin with, it seemed silly to start. A Star Wars crack-pipe dream it remained.

It can be so difficult making a decision. “What’re you having, Obz?” my aunt Tita Blitte asked me.
