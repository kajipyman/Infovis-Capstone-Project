The first is that it only has a limited screening all over the country. In Davao, the film opened on Wednesday in four cinemas. Davao has 27 cinemas, so four is generous for a local indie film. But the next day, it was down to only two cinemas. Sadder still, the time slots given to the film are in the afternoon slots, a not so convenient time for people coming from work or wanting to have a late night movie date.

The now defunct Philippine Constabulary (PC) could, at that time, just invite a person to its headquarters and book him for no reason at all.

Thus, he said, he wouldn’t resign. Last Saturday (Oct. 6), amid new questions about his health, he said Robredo is weak “when it comes to strategy” and for that he wouldn’t “hand” her the presidency.
