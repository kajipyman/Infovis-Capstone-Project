Estrada, who's facing plunder and graft charges at the Sandiganbayan, revealed to CNN Philippines Friday that his camp may soon file a demurrer to evidence, or a motion to dismiss a case for lack of sufficient evidence.

He and his close pal Jinggoy Estrada, who is also running for senator, can even campaign together. Estrada is out on bail. Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile can join them on the road.

Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. was that scene wherein the wife and daughter of Revilla’s aide, Richard Cambe, tearfully embraced him. Cambe, along with businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, was found guilty of plunder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Cambe looked lost in that scene. Contrast that with the smile on the faces of Revilla, his relatives and friends. While Cambe and Napoles were convicted, Revilla was acquitted.
