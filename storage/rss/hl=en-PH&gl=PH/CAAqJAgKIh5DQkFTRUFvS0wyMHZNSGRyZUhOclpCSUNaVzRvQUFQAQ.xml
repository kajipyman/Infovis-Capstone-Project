Estrada shared this to reporters outside the Philippine National Police (PNP) Custodial Center on Friday, December 7, right after he paid a visit to Revilla, who was just waiting for his release order with his family and staff in the detention facility. “Sa ngayon (Now), Senator Bong has been vindicated.

The High Court denied their separate petitions challenging the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan's 2014 decision to deny their applications for bail.
