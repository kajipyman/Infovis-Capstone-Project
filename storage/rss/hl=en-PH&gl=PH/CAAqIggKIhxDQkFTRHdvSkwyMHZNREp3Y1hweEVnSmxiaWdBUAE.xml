"Majority of the senators, even those running for re-election will fight tooth and nail any attempt to cancel the 2019 midterm elections simply because it is wrong and self-serving," Senator Panfilo Lacson said in a statement Thursday. This is in response to Alvarez's remark that Congress should pass a law postponing the May 2019 polls so that lawmakers can focus on drafting a new constituti...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://cnnphilippines.com">CNN Philippines</source></item></channel></rss>
