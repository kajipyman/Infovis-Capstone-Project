The bright hue of coral has been named the 2019 colour of the year, having appeared on the runway, in modern makeup looks and across the media as of late. Every year, design company Pantone decides upon its colour of the year by taking cultural trends into account.

Living Coral has been chosen by the Pantone Color Institute as its 2019 color of the year. Can a color be convivial? Laurie Pressman, the company's vice president, considers this saturated orange base with a golden undertone not only warm and welcoming but versatile and life-affirming.

Designers often rip out individual color chips to create mood boards that inform the entire look and feel of a project. [Photo: Chip Slip]But what to do with the ripped-out chips? Instead of taping them back in place or storing them in disorganized envelopes for safekeeping, as many Pantone users do, designer Jesse Reed came up with a custom solution: vinyl pockets perfectly sized for the chips that clip right into Pantone binders.

In the world of fashion and design, Pantone Color of the Year is among the things that is being looked forward to every year. The Pantone Color Institute gives this forecast to guide companies in developing their brand identity and products. For 2018, the group identified “ultra violet” as the newest global color trend. This replaces 2017’s “greenery” which represents the color at the start of spring: a combination of “fresh and zesty” yellow-green.
