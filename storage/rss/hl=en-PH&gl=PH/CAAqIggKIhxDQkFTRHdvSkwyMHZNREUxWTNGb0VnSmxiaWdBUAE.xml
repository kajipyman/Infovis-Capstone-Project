On Instagram, Arnel, who is the current frontman of the group, expressed his joy upon meeting one of the singers he admires. "One of the sweetest hugs you can ever get from one of my heroes and silent mentors... it means the world to me. Waited 35 years for this moment. Thank you almighty God!

However, some of his bandmates already have, and he’s not happy about it. Last week, Schon shared a post on Facebook in which he called out three of his bandmates ― keyboardist Jonathan Cain, bassist Ross Valory, and frontman Arnel Pineda ― who visited the White House last Thursday. Schon, a founding member of the band, seems to believe the publicized meeting was done with the intention of exploiting the Journey brand, and it doesn’t sit well with him. He also claims it was arranged without his knowledge....&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>Journey performs in Manila after 8 years - CNN Philippines</title><link>http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2017/02/17/Journey-performs-in-Manila-after-8-years.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENKcyOou0p3LP3I3VBMeJIoqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowqJnyCjCDutUBMLXvpAM</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2017 04:18:53 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2017/02/17/Journey-performs-in-Manila-after-8-years.html" target="_blank"&gt;Journey performs in Manila after 8 years&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN Philippines&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metro Manila (CNN Philippines) — Avid rock fans should not miss the "one night only concert" of American rock band Journey.

The rock band, famous for the hits "Don't Stop Believin'," "Open Arms," and "Faithfully," among others, last performed in Manila in 2009.

Then Music Saved His Life Again.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine riding a motorcycle down an open road in the country, with alfalfa fields on both sides as far as the eye can see ― with a warm wind blowing in your hair and the sun beating down on your face. That’s a lot of what singer Steve Perry has done since playing his last show with Journey in 1987. At the top of his game, he decided to walk away, leaving one of the biggest bands around. This after scoring hit after hit with “Don’t Stop Believin’,” “Faithfully,” “Open Arms” and “Separate Ways” ― on top of solo singles “Oh Sherrie” and “Foolish Heart.” “I wasn’t going to walk away through the...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>Iceland: In the Westfjords - Water has its Origin in Paradise - 500px</title><link>https://500px.com/photo/274075621/iceland-in-the-westfjords-water-has-its-origin-in-paradise-by-daniel-meyer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEFbunmq_Hohq7AhvgF3EEWoqFQgEKg0IACoGCAow26UBMPBEMMD7CQ</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 18:26:03 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://500px.com/photo/274075621/iceland-in-the-westfjords-water-has-its-origin-in-paradise-by-daniel-meyer" target="_blank"&gt;Iceland: In the Westfjords - Water has its Origin in Paradise&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;500px&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Journey, new Pics.

Here's what some of them have done in the years since: Famed composer and producer Quincy Jones oversaw the song. Jones, now in his 80s, won an album of the year Grammy for 1989's "Back on the Block" and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. There's even a Los Angeles elementary school named for him.

They better, because the taxi stops the moment they stop vocalizing. The “singalong shuffle,” as it is called, will be unveiled this weekend during the Ruisrock music festival in Turku, Finland, according to Mashable. As part of a promotion by Fortum, a clean energy company based in northern Europe, attendees will be able to traipse around the festival grounds in an electrically-powered BMW i3 for free.

Released in June 1981, the song appeared on the rock band’s seventh album, “Escape.” Although it never made it to No. 1 on the charts, “Don’t Stop Believin’” has seeped into our culture in countless ways. The “Sopranos” series finale. That memorable “Glee” pilot episode. Broadway’s “Rock of Ages” musical. Your karaoke night.

But she is not alone. There are plenty more big stars who have failed to get that gramophone trophy every singer dreams of. Remember when the cast of the TV series “Glee” earned a Grammy nomination for their version of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” at the 2011 Grammys, pitting them against Sade, Maroon 5 and Paramore? But guess who never earned a nomination for “Don’t Stop Believin"? Journey.

(Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET) It may feel as if Bruno Mars has always been a fixture of the Top 40 world, but believe it or not, his debut album is only a little more than seven years old. In less than a decade, he’s been able to conquer the charts in a way few before him have ever done, and this week, his first full-length earns another spot in the history books.
