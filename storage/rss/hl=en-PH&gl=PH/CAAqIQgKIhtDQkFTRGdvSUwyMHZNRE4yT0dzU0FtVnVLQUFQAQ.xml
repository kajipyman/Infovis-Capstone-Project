The main contention to the withdrawal is that the president supposedly needs the concurrence of the Senate to withdraw. Under the Constitution, the Senate must concur to pass a treaty, but is silent on withdrawal. The lack of a clear text is what’s in dispute at the Supreme Court, which has finished oral arguments on petitions seeking to nullify the withdrawal.
