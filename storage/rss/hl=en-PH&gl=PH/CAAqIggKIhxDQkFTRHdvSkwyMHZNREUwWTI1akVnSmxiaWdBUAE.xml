Many of the country’s most intelligent, thoughtful and perceptive people do not attend either Oxford or Cambridge. Both institutions are instead, disproportionately, attended by the best performing slice of the most economically privileged teenagers in the country. So the figures released today, which elicit a depressing sense of deja vu, that eight top schools send as many pupils to Oxbridge as three-quarters of all schools and colleges put together, might be shocking, but they are unsurprising...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Cambridge gives role to academic accused of racist stereotyping - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/cambridge-gives-role-to-academic-accused-of-racist-stereotyping</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOyMZwUvRY_CrpZB-qk4wvsqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDZ4PsF</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 18:27:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/cambridge-gives-role-to-academic-accused-of-racist-stereotyping" target="_blank"&gt;Cambridge gives role to academic accused of racist stereotyping&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Cambridge professors and academics from around the world have attacked the appointment of a social scientist whose work they say has stoked “racist, xenophobic, fascist and anti-immigration rhetoric”.

But Lakier qualified for a federal student loan forgiveness program. “The plan was, I would wait 20 years and if I made those minimum payments, the rest would be forgiven,” he remembers.
