Dozens of small tremors have been registered near the company’s Preston New Road site, after it started pumping high volumes of water underground in October to explore for gas. Several signs suggest the company has not undertaken any fracking in the past fortnight.

He did not offer help, condolences or even prayers for those killed ― the toll is now at least 63 ― in the deadliest fire in the state’s history. Instead, he offered an explanation for the wildfires ― California’s “poor forest management” ― and threatened to withhold federal recovery funds. Poor forest management is a nod to logging interests and, for reasons others have pointed out, is not the root cause of California’s year-round wildfire problem.

Two of those have been powerful enough to exceed a regulatory threshold that requires fracking to stop, and on a third occasion the company voluntarily ceased operations when it neared the limit.
