Chelsea looked to have bounced back from their first defeat of the season against Tottenham with victory over Fulham last weekend, but a second loss quickly followed in the Midlands at Wolves in midweek. Pep Guardiola's side however have dropped just two points all season and have won their last seven top-flight games, and so will be hoping to inflict another defeat on the hosts.
