After all, this is a studio who missed out on a bonus from publisher Bethesda because their game, Fallout: New Vegas, didn\u2019t top 85 on Metacritic.

This revelation was made worse when Bethesda\u2019s customer service responded in a less-than-helpful manner, sparking more outrage and frustration among players and some severe articles in th..."
