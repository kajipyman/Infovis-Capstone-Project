People died of HIV / AIDS when George HW Bush left office. His inaction allowed the virus to spread, stigma to grow, and so many vulnerable people in the cold.

A report by the International HIV/AIDS Alliance looked at the link between gender-based violence and HIV in the Middle East and North Africa. It found the problem went both ways and women are also at increased risk of HIV due to the violence, cultural stigma and discrimination they endure. Luisa Orza, who is in charge of gender at the charity, described the correlation between gender-based violence and HIV as a “cyclical two-way dynamic”.

It was a shock but probably not a surprise. After a seven-year relationship which ended in 2013 I was dealing with a lot of emotional trauma and I really struggled to find my feet as a single gay man in 2013. The landscape was so different from 2006. I found myself without the tools or experience to manage hook-up apps, chemsex and single life in a “healthy” way. I still consider myself lucky though – I was diagnosed in what I call “the year of no fear”.

Thanks to PEPFAR— the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief—14.6 million people living with HIV (59%) have access to antiretroviral therapy. More than 2.4 million babies have been born HIV-free. Countless lives have been saved. This progress was unthinkable when I was a surgical resident in training in the 1980s, studying the latest medical literature and tracking this mysterious new virus.
