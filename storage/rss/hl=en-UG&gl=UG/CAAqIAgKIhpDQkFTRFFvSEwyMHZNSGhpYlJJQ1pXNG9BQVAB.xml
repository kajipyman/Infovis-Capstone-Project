City’s 1-0 win against the defending champions in September last year, secured by a stunning second-half goal from midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, won widespread plaudits and was one of the highlights of a remarkable 18-match winning run in the Premier League.

The Belgian, who recently got rid of his own trademark afro, escaped punishment from the referee, Andre Marriner, and Emery believes the incident is now cut and dried.
