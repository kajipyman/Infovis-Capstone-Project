The long-awaited fantasy RPG is reportedly still early in development, but BioWare has teased its fans with a short video and the phrase The Dread Wolf Rises; a reference to elven apostate Solas. Far Cry: New Dawn, a direct post-apocalyptic sequel to Ubisoft's open-world shooter Far Cry 5, was unveiled for 15 February 2019. The game is set 17 years after Far Cry 5, with a 'super-bloom' transforming the setting of Hope County into a vivid, colourful post-nuclear land.

Finally. It looks like we’ll find out something new about BioWare’s next Dragon Age game in December. I know, it’s kind of silly to talk about a teaser for what will almost certainly end up being yet another teaser for an announcement of some kind, but this is Dragon Age we’re talking about, and I still have high hopes. I harbor such fond memories of Dragon Age: Origins. I can’t help but be a little excited to see what’s in the pipeline (and a little worried, of course.)

Bioware, so famed for its sprawling story-based single-player role-playing games, is doing just that with Anthem. Broadly billed as publisher EA's answer to Destiny, Anthem is a shared-world multiplayer shooter in which you play as a 'freelancer', a super-soldier packed into a Javelin exosuit, sent to complete missions and gather loot in its ornate sci-fi fantasy world. And what a world it is.

Thanksgiving is behind us and Christmas fast approaches. As holiday shopping kicks into full gear, there are still some ways to get free stuff instead of forking over more of your hard-earned cash. For Xbox One and Xbox 360 players, if you happen to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold, there’s a handful of free titles coming your way in December.

In my time with Mass Effect: Andromeda so far I’ve encountered a litany of bugs, glitches and other issues. Characters sometimes occupy the same space, jagged polygons not so much jostling one another as cutting and overlapping, heads popping in and out of shoulders. Facial animations that make human characters look like crazed robots, or crackheads, or lunatics, grinning eerily, eyes rolling about their skulls. Various other visual ticks. The stuff of nightmares.

Mass Effect: Andromeda, out yesterday, is coming down on the latter. Part of it concerns lackluster reviews, part of it concerns cringe-worthy GIFs, and part of it is just the general sense that something is off about it. That whatever special sauce BioWare brewed back with Mass Effect 1+2 is thinned out and maybe had its issues to begin with. What’s clear is that there’s a backlash going on.

Recently the rumor mill started grinding out a big one: BioWare Austin was supposedly working on a new Knights of the Old Republic Game. The rumor started thanks to Liam Robertson who mentioned he’d heard about the project in a podcast. But according to Kotaku’s Jason Schreier, these are old rumors based on a prototype of a new KotR game that’s since been shelved.

But the more I hear about BioWare’s promised “substantial” story component of Anthem, the more concerned I get. BioWare is trying to blend its traditional storytelling prowess with a story that involves legions of similar players doing similar things, often co-operatively. And that means quite a shift from say, Dragon Age or Mass Effect.

The main event was clearly the all-out reveal of Anthem, which took up the closing portion of the broadcast, and is our longest look at the game yet.

EA is moving the release date of its upcoming BioWare space shooter Anthem to early 2019. That’s a smart decision, and one that gamers and BioWare fans should applaud. While the move had been rumored already, EA made the announcement official in its earnings report. Not only will this give the game more development time, resulting in a more complete and polished product at launch, it means that it won’t be awkwardly wedged between DICE’s Battlefield game and Treyarch’s Call of Duty release.

I highly suggest you read the entire thing here, as I will not be bullet pointing the entire thing as that would be lame.
