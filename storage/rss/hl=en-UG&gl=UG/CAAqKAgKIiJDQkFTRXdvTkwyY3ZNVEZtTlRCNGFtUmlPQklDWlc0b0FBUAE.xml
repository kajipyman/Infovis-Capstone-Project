The news was revealed at the end of the Japanese video game giant's Nintendo Direct video stream, which showcased the company's upcoming games for both Switch and Nintendo 3DS. There was little information revealed on the game, but featured the famously penny-pinching tanuki Tom Nook announcing he needed to build a new town for his friends.

Nintendo just revealed a long list of “Nindies’ coming to the Nintendo Switch over the next few months. These indie releases range from platformers to RPGs to tactical turn-based games. There’s a lot coming to the Nintendo Switch in late 2018 and early 2019 aside from the big releases like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Here’s the full list. I haven’t played all of these (on other platforms) but I have played some.

In his face, you can see the prodigious teenager he once was. Sakurai was 19 when he directed his first game, Kirby’s Dream Land, at HAL Laboratory, a Tokyo developer that made a string of excellent games for Nintendo’s consoles in the 90s. His parents were perplexed; in their generation, video games didn’t exist. “They never supported me actively, there was a lot of uncertainty and fear,” he recalls. “That said, after I worked on the Kirby games, I noticed that all of a sudden my parents had Kirby paraphernalia hanging around the ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Nintendo Reveals Five New 'Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate would contain every single fighter from every past game, it seemed like perhaps there wasn’t all that much more to debut. But that was not the case, as Nintendo had a Direct today that they jammed full of information, including a number of reveals. We’ll start with the most pressing additions, five new characters, two of which are truly new, three of which are “echo fighters,” which are clones of existing fighters, but with new looks and animations.

In total, shares are down about 34% since March. What on earth is going on? We’re supposed to still be living in a Nintendo renaissance of sorts, a golden era in the wake of smash hits like Pokémon GO (which caused a huge stock jump in summer 2016) and the Switch (which has continued the trend since release). 2017 brought us two of N...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item></channel></rss>
