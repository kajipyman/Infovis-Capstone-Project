Suddenly, the sound of gunshots pierced the air. Teachers yelled to the students to run and hide. “We were running where we could not hear the gunfire,” he recalls. The year was 1985 and rebels from southern Sudan were waging a war for independence against the government in the north. Dut escaped that day with others who fled into the bush. The group walked for months, sometimes going days without food or water, before reaching the Itang Refugee Camp in western Ethiopia.

Easy access to weapons empowers violent political groups, criminals and terrorists, hastens the descent of vulnerable societies into conflict and greatly magnifies the toll and duration of war. From Syria and Libya to South Sudan and Somalia, the illicit supply of weapons has fuelled conflict, reversed socio-economic development gains to pre-1960s levels, and undermined successive efforts to broker peace.

It is the largest dowry ever paid in the civil war-torn country, the government said. The highest bidder was a man three times the 17-year-old's age.
