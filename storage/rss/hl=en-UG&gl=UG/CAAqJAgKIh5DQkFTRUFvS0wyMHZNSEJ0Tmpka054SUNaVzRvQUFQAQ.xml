Even though it feels like Activision is just mining our childhoods for gold at this point, I’m not complaining, because what we’re getting in return is just too damn good.

It was 1994 and Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin had decided to work on a 3D action-platform game in which the main character would run into the screen, tackle obstacles and collect things. Two years later, and with the developer having created its own programming language and compression software in a bid to get the game running fluidly on the PSOne, the game was ready.

Forty four eastern barred bandicoots were relocated as part of the first release onto Phillip Island, which was declared fox-free earlier this year after a decade long eradication program.
