The long-awaited fantasy RPG is reportedly still early in development, but BioWare has teased its fans with a short video and the phrase The Dread Wolf Rises; a reference to elven apostate Solas. Far Cry: New Dawn, a direct post-apocalyptic sequel to Ubisoft's open-world shooter Far Cry 5, was unveiled for 15 February 2019. The game is set 17 years after Far Cry 5, with a 'super-bloom' transforming the setting of Hope County into a vivid, colourful post-nuclear land.

Finally. It looks like we’ll find out something new about BioWare’s next Dragon Age game in December. I know, it’s kind of silly to talk about a teaser for what will almost certainly end up being yet another teaser for an announcement of some kind, but this is Dragon Age we’re talking about, and I still have high hopes. I harbor such fond memories of Dragon Age: Origins. I can’t help but be a little excited to see what’s in the pipeline (and a little worried, of course.)

Bioware, so famed for its sprawling story-based single-player role-playing games, is doing just that with Anthem. Broadly billed as publisher EA's answer to Destiny, Anthem is a shared-world multiplayer shooter in which you play as a 'freelancer', a super-soldier packed into a Javelin exosuit, sent to complete missions and gather loot in its ornate sci-fi fantasy world. And what a world it is.

As gorgeous as Horizon Zero Dawn truly is, that doesn’t mean it’s particularly fun or interesting. After my initial letdown with the game, I kept hoping I’d start to like it more as I journeyed further in. But most of my enjoyment is coming from the visuals, which are striking to say the least. I’ve played the game on both a standard PS4 with a non-HDR 4K TV and on an LG OLED 4K panel with HDR on a PS4 Pro. There is a world of difference, perhaps the most I’ve seen from any game so far. On the PS4 Pro, Horizon Zero Dawn is breathta...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>Even After 5 Years In Development, 'Mass Effect: Andromeda' Feels Rushed - Forbes Now</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/03/21/even-after-5-years-in-development-mass-effect-andromeda-feels-rushed/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPrKOz8OmC5bgPupsNTUe4kqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 16:50:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/03/21/even-after-5-years-in-development-mass-effect-andromeda-feels-rushed/" target="_blank"&gt;Even After 5 Years In Development, 'Mass Effect: Andromeda' Feels Rushed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe ‘Mass Effect: Andromeda’ needed more time in the oven. In my time with Mass Effect: Andromeda so far I’ve encountered a litany of bugs, glitches and other issues. Characters sometimes occupy the same space, jagged polygons not so much jostling one another as cutting and overlapping, heads popping in and out of shoulders. Facial animations that make human characters look like crazed robots, or crackheads, or lunatics, grinning eerily, eyes rolling about their skulls. Various other visual ticks. The stuff of nightmares.

BioWare itself is releasing some new info about the game, namely an eye-catching interview with (Game of Thrones spoilers ahead) Natalie Dormer, aka Margaery Tyrell, who will be voicing one of your crew members, an Asari doctor.

Mass Effect: Andromeda, out yesterday, is coming down on the latter. Part of it concerns lackluster reviews, part of it concerns cringe-worthy GIFs, and part of it is just the general sense that something is off about it. That whatever special sauce BioWare brewed back with Mass Effect 1+2 is thinned out and maybe had its issues to begin with. What’s clear is that there’s a backlash going on.

And I’m not saying that to make you feel bad, Xbox One owners.

EA is moving the release date of its upcoming BioWare space shooter Anthem to early 2019. That’s a smart decision, and one that gamers and BioWare fans should applaud. While the move had been rumored already, EA made the announcement official in its earnings report. Not only will this give the game more development time, resulting in a more complete and polished product at launch, it means that it won’t be awkwardly wedged between DICE’s Battlefield game and Treyarch’s Call of Duty release.
