Intel Corp, an Olympic sponsor, brought professional gamers to PyongChang, where the Olympics are now in full swing, earlier this week. They played Starcraft II, a popular real-time strategy game that involves tactical thinking, concentration and quick reflexes – and rekindled the debate on whether the rigorous requirements are enough for eSports to become part of the Olympics.

Although there are a number of video game conferences out there to connect fans, there hasn’t yet been any major conventions that are primarily focused on esports as opposed to video games more generally. That’s a major void that the organizers of the Expo are interested in filling. “There are a lot of shows that cover video games very broadly,” said J...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>Meet Australian sport's next big thing - ABC News</title><link>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-28/the-esports-phenomenon-moves-into-australia/9357496</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEH7Vh5lPpvtFDnIYnCEWDukqFggEKg4IACoGCAow3vI9MPeaCDDc2g4</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2018 22:13:16 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-28/the-esports-phenomenon-moves-into-australia/9357496" target="_blank"&gt;Meet Australian sport's next big thing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;ABC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus Gomes is 20 years old, packs a slight frame and — with not one A-League goal to his name — has become one of the hottest signings in Australian soccer. Meet the new world of competitive online gaming — or esports — a sophisticated and professional cyber sporting code which is starting to attract the attention of some of Australia's biggest traditional clubs. The world of esports can be split into categories of games such as fighting, first-person shooter, sporting, multiplayer online battle arenas and real-time strategy. Every esports game is different, with different games played on...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC News</source></item><item><title>'Insurgency: Sandstorm' Looks Like The Shooter To Beat In 2018 - Forbes Now</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/01/31/insurgency-sandstorm-looks-like-the-shooter-to-beat-in-2018/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOyYzhrQXpywCo8glbrWN0wqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/01/31/insurgency-sandstorm-looks-like-the-shooter-to-beat-in-2018/" target="_blank"&gt;'Insurgency: Sandstorm' Looks Like The Shooter To Beat In 2018&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurgency: Sandstorm looks incredible. Insurgency: Sandstorm is one of my most highly-anticipated first-person shooters of 2018. Recently stripped of its single-player campaign, the game is now 100% multiplayer focused. That was probably the right decision for New World Entertainment to make—doubling down on what’s made their previous games so top-notch rather than squandering resources on an expensive campaign. (Note: I’d still love to play a solo campaign made by this team, but I absolutely understand why this has been cut.) In any case, check out this new trailer for the game and tell m...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item><item><title>‘They see the potential’: why J-Lo and Gillette want a piece of the eSports action - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/games/2017/dec/25/esports-jennifer-lopez-gillette-audi-mercedes-benz-a-piece-of-the-action</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEI4wcBIULwCBIa4fRqNisjsqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTCOvRU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 12:35:19 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2017/dec/25/esports-jennifer-lopez-gillette-audi-mercedes-benz-a-piece-of-the-action" target="_blank"&gt;‘They see the potential’: why J-Lo and Gillette want a piece of the eSports action&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are any doubts that computer games can become a mainstream spectator sport, then Jennifer Lopez and Stan Kroenke are not listening. The superstar singer and Arsenal’s majority shareholder have both put money into eSports teams, as the gaming competitions with millions of followers worldwide aim for even greater public appeal. Lopez has bought into a team franchise for the new Overwatch League, in which teams from cities such as Seoul, San Francisco and London play Overwatch, a mass-participation shooting game.

It’s been a decade since Valve released the Orange Box, one of video gaming’s most important box-sets filled with a treasure trove of now-classic games. The box, which actually released as a physical box rather than just a digital purchase (rare on PC these days) came out on October 10th, 2007 on PC and Xbox 360, with a PS3 version releasing later that same year. The Orange Box was met with universal critical acclaim, Team Fortress 2 remains one of the most popular games on Steam. The Orange Box included: - Half-Life 2 - Half-Life 2: Episode 1 - Half-Life 2: ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes Now</source></item></channel></rss>
