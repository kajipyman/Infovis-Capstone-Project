With the attention is now on the S10 Plus the latest information give us the clearest idea yet of the upcoming South Korean flagship. The S10 Plus is the third of four handsets, lying just behind the powerful Galaxy S10 Ultra (which is expected to be the ‘specs monster’ with multiple cameras and potentially 5G connectivity), just ahead of the standard Galaxy S10, and well ahead of the entry-level S10 model. The Plus likely denotes a larger screen size (much as it does with the S9 and S9 Plus).

There will be four models (including a new, more affordable version), up to six cameras, massive displays and ‘gradient’ colour schemes. And now Samsung isn’t even trying to hide its biggest upgrade of all… In a pair of official announcements which are about as subtle as a brick, both Verizon and AT&amp;T have announced a partnership with Samsung to deliver a ‘5G Galaxy smartphone’ in the first half of 2019.

If you want to upgrade your smartphone but you’re on a limited budget, Samsung is offering the best Black Friday deals of 2018. The Galaxy maker has discounted its entire 2018 top-tier range by $200. These discounts are for unlocked devices too, which is important because ‘deals’ at other retailers require signing up to a 24-month contract. So that means the Note 9 and Galaxy S9 are $200 cheaper. Buyers can also trade in old devices for further discounts, so you could potentially pick up the Note 9 or Galaxy S9 for $500 less than you’d normally pay.

Samsung is no stranger to the Black Friday madness, and in fairness, the Galaxy maker often discounts much of its latest tech. This year is no different. Directly from the Samsung store, most of its 2018 flagship devices get a price cut and there are similar discounts at major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy.

The South Korean technology giant on Wednesday said its operating profit during the July-September quarter grew at nearly a 21 percent annual pace to 17.6 trillion won ($15.4 billion). Samsung's previous high in quarterly profit was the 15.6 trillion won it posted during the first quarter.

So when a newcomer brings something innovative to the party, why is it difficult to break through a phone market dominated by Apple and Samsung? One such smartphone comes out this week from Red, a company with roots in digital cameras for movie productions.

Of course, the biggest problem with today’s top smartphones is the cash you need to shell out to get them. And try as you might, you might not always find the best deals on the smartphone you want.

The Mate 20 Pro is the best feeling, most premium device the Chinese firm has made.

None other than Samsung itself… Picked up by both Chinese site ITHome and perennial Samsung leaks champion Ice Universe, Samsung held an event this week in Asia for the ‘Galaxy A8s’ – a limited edition successor to its popular A8.

The smaller of Google’s new Pixel smartphones is arguably the best small Android phone going, and the Pixel 3 XL shares many of its best traits. The backs of the devices are a spitting image of each other – two-tone glass, part polished, part etched. The glossy coated metal sides and glass back have a luxurious, smooth feel in the hand.
