Cube Island, the former Loot Lake island and house that the Cube has been levitating around the map, has exploded, breaking into pieces that are floating above Loot (Leaky) Lake. You can still land on the pieces for a bit of loot, but that house is dead, and now the Cube itself is back to levitating above the lake unencumbered by the island. You can bounce on it and hover over it endlessly.

Or is it Happy Fortnitemares? I can never remember. Regardless, it’s a big morning here in the world of Fortnite: Battle Royale. It’s time for Halloween, which means spooky decorations all over the map, not to mention a series of new challenges, new cosmetics and, in case that wasn’t enough, “cube monsters” that will spawn all over the map, bringing a little bit of Save the World to Battle Royale. Completing all the challengtes will net you a slick new glider, and they’re coming in waves.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 got off to a pretty great start last weekend. The game is getting great reviews (mine won’t be out until the game has been in the wild for a couple weeks precisely because of the issues I discuss in this post) and it’s making Activision great big heaps of money. I’m really enjoying both multiplayer and Blackout (the game’s new battle royale mode) but not everyone is happy. If you’ve noticed that Black Ops 4 feels a little less smooth than it did during the beta, the reason may be ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Even With A Delay, 'Battlefield 5' Feels Like It's In A Precarious Position - Forbes</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/10/20/even-with-a-delay-battlefield-5-feels-like-its-in-a-precarious-position/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEOpTIYmwvQTTtJYzphWCuY4qFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMMGBAg</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 16:44:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/10/20/even-with-a-delay-battlefield-5-feels-like-its-in-a-precarious-position/" target="_blank"&gt;Even With A Delay, 'Battlefield 5' Feels Like It's In A Precarious Position&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Forbes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battlefield V We are now in what was supposed to be the debut weekend of Battlefield V, EA’s sequel to Battlefield 1 in one of the series’ most baffling naming decisions yet. But wisely EA chose to stay out of the middle of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 last week and Red Dead Redemption 2 this coming week, and instead delayed Battlefield V to November 20 instead, a somewhat less competitive date, though their reason given was that they just wanted more time to polish the game.

Maybe there’s something about fourths, because it was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare that changed what the series was and could be in 2007. The critically acclaimed single-player campaign made a splash, but the waves that its multiplayer version left behind are still being felt all these years later. Ever since, the online modes have been many players’ real draw to the games. Now, they’re all that they have.

It used to be that we’d see new challenges leaked on a regular basis, and that they would line up pretty well with the challenges that actually showed up in game. Not so anymore: the lists are further diverging from reality, whether that’s intentional obfuscation or just the need to shift things around for whatever reason.

And while there is part of me that still hankers for my yearly fix of the breakneck bombast and ooh-ra melodrama of a Call of Duty campaign, Black Ops 4 won me over with its ebullient variety and extraordinary polish. It is, simply put, the most fun I’ve had with a FPS multiplayer package since Overwatch rewrote the rulebook in 2016.
