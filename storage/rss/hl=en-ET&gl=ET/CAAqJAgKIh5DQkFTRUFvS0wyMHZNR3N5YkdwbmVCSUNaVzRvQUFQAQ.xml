This is because the pre-launch strategy helps build an audience for your campaign even before you actually launch. In turn, it creates an extra boost within the first 48 hours after launch. Based on experience, we know that campaigns that reach around 50% of their goal within the first 48 hours are more likely to succeed than others. However, to get that amount of attention, you need to have an audience to back you up.

At the time, Facebook was widely considered the smaller part of the digital ad duopoly–the unofficial online empire comprised of the social network and Google. Together, they controlled the lion’s share of digital consumption; they were the online ad kings.

Facebook had already delayed the video-calling device due to privacy concerns around the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And when it finally did launch, there was a glaring omission: no voice assistant from Facebook.
