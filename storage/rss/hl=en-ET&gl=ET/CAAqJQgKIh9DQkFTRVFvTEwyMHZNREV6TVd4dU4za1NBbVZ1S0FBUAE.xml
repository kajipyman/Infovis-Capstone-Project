The show represented a huge risk for the streaming service as it sought to make the leap from tech start-up to entertainment industry goliath. Five years on and the gamble has paid off.

Which episode exactly will mark the departure of Rick Grimes remains to be seen, but AMC’s decision to release a synopsis for every episode bar the ninth season’s sixth outing hints that it could arrive as early as three weeks. The synopsis for episode 9x05 – titled “What Comes After” – reads: “Rick is forced to face the past as he struggles to maintain the safety of the communities and protect the future he and Carl envisioned.” - Read more ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.independent.co.uk">The Independent</source></item><item><title>Streaming’s greatest hits: the best TV shows from Netflix and Amazon - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/14/netflix-v-amazon-streaming-tv-top-shows</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELQluwFHg43G0ONeU80o7LMqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDMwRU</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 06:00:12 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/14/netflix-v-amazon-streaming-tv-top-shows" target="_blank"&gt;Streaming’s greatest hits: the best TV shows from Netflix and Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix and Amazon have invested billions of dollars in producing original content for their streaming platforms.

Barr was infamously fired from the sitcom Roseanne earlier this year after posting racist messages on Twitter, with the show continuing without her under a new name, The Connors. The fate of her character had been kept heavily under wraps by the series’ network ABC and was revealed during the first episode, titled “Keep on Trucking”.

The two series are so alike that only their mother – or perhaps Auntie – could tell them apart. Where Bodyguard was a six-part thriller about a caring but troubled police officer (Richard Madden) fighting sophisticated terrorists in London, Informer is a six-part thriller about a caring but troubled counter-terrorism officer (Paddy Considine) fighting sophisticated terrorists in London. The obvious defence of the scheduling is that they are to be seen as companion pieces.

As first reported by Variety, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat are currently working on a fresh version of Bram Stoker's tale.

By the time the midseason finale airs in December, both actors will have exited the show although details on what will happen to their characters - Rick Grimes and Maggie Rhee - are currently unclear.
