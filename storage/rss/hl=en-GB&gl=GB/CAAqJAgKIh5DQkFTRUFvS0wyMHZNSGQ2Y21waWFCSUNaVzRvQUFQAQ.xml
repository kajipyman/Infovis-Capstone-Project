The Welsh side have climbed out of the relegation zone and are 13th in the league, winning 17 points from the Portuguese manager's nine games in charge.

Yet one month into his reign, it is hard not to spot a strange alchemy being worked in south Wales. Strikers who could not score are suddenly finding the net, midfielders once booed by the crowd as ineffectual are cheered off the pitch and defenders accustomed to seeing balls fly past them are standing tall.

Swansea's 5-0 defeat by Liverpool on Tuesday marked their ninth defeat in 12 games, leaving the Welsh side five points adrift of safety, having won just three of 20 matches so far. The Swans escaped relegation last season after recruiting Martin Olsson, Tom Carroll, Luciano Narsingh and Jordan Ayew in January and Britton is hopeful that a raft of new signings would have a si...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://uk.reuters.com">Reuters UK</source></item><item><title>Swansea appoint much-travelled Carvalhal as manager - Reuters UK</title><link>https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-swa-carvalhal/swansea-appoint-much-travelled-carvalhal-as-manager-idUKKBN1EM13D</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELizGAjC7vHwNZXtKPLAM64qGAgEKg8IACoHCAow3MukCjD92XcwroPqAQ</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 12:48:21 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-swa-carvalhal/swansea-appoint-much-travelled-carvalhal-as-manager-idUKKBN1EM13D" target="_blank"&gt;Swansea appoint much-travelled Carvalhal as manager&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters UK&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Premier League's bottom team Swansea City have appointed Carlos Carvalhal as manager until the end of the season with an option of an extension, the Welsh club said on Thursday. Portuguese manager Carvalhal parted company with second-tier Sheffield Wednesday on Christmas Eve after two and a half years at Hillsborough, leading them to Championship play-offs in successive seasons but failing to take them into the top flight. The 52-year-old Portuguese replaces Paul Clement, who left the Welsh club earlier this month propping up the league after less than a year in charge.

Leon Britton took that drastic step at Anfield and no one representing Swansea City could complain. No fight, no heart and precious little quality; this was a performance that deserved damnation.

Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho opened the scoring after Swansea conceded possession in their own half with Roberto Firmino scoring the second after being left unmarked for a free-kick. The Welsh side's defensive errors also contributed to the Merseyside club's next three goals and Britton criticised his side's sloppy performance.

There are problems on the field, off the field and just about everywhere you look, so much so that it seems like a trick of the imagination that only a few years ago they were hailed as the Premier League’s model club. Who on earth would want to follow their example now? For a third season running they are mired in a relegation battle, anchored to the bottom of the table and caught up in a dismal cycle of failure that sees the club lurch from crisis to crisis, hire and fire managers, and never for a moment stop to address the deeper, underlying problems...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>West Ham identify Swansea City’s Alfie Mawson as key target - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/21/swansea-manager-leon-britton-caretaker-paul-clement</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJoU08zZ8QtMzNvZaRZEGgkqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTCtvRU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 12:10:20 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/21/swansea-manager-leon-britton-caretaker-paul-clement" target="_blank"&gt;West Ham identify Swansea City’s Alfie Mawson as key target&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swansea City face a battle to hold on to Alfie Mawson in the January transfer window amid serious interest from West Ham United, who are expected to make a bid for the central defender. The Hammers have identified Mawson, who caught the eye for England Under-21s at the European Championship finals in the summer, as one of their key targets next month and are ready to test Swansea’s resolve. The Welsh club, who are bottom of the Premier League and without a manager after Paul Clement’s dismissal on Wednesday, rate Mawson highly and are determined to hold on to him as they try to plot a route...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item></channel></rss>
