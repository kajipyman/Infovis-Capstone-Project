The much-loved Richard Curtis rom-com was originally released back in May 1994 and starred Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell and Kristin Scott Thomas. Grant won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal of protagonist Charles that same year.

He appeared in A Room With A View (1985), Four Weddings And A Funeral (1994) and Shakespeare In Love (1998). He performs a new adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s De Profundis at the Vaudeville theatre in London from 3-6 January and stars in The Rebel, on Gold. When were you happiest?

Partridge Family star David Cassidy was an exception. David Cassidy, the shaggy-haired star of The Partridge Family whose teen heartthrob appeal made him one of the most enduring male icons of the ’70s, passed away Tuesday at a Florida hospital following organ failure and a battle with dementia. He was 67. Publicist John Geffen released a statement from Cassidy’s family to Variety: On behalf of the entire Cassidy family, it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, our uncle, and our dear brother, David Cassidy.

It was 1998 and I was living in Notting Hill with my boyfriend and two children. As it was our last year in the house (one bedroom, two kids, son slept in the bathroom as nowhere else to go, time to move), we decided to have a final hoorah that December. We’d asked one of the hot-dog stalls on Portobello Road to park outside the house to supply the catering (hot dogs, ver ver Christmassy) and we’d done the whole mulled wine, Christmas tree, crisps, dodgy music thing. We’d also optimistically rented a Santa outfit in the hope we could persuad...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Four Weddings and a Funeral to receive TV reboot - The Independent</title><link>http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-tv-reboot-mindy-kaling-hulu-series-1-season-cast-trailer-a8033726.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEK5qhAUC3AfWUIV1Udpfz0gqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTD-yBU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 13:41:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-tv-reboot-mindy-kaling-hulu-series-1-season-cast-trailer-a8033726.html" target="_blank"&gt;Four Weddings and a Funeral to receive TV reboot&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable somebody would dig up Four Weddings and Funeral for a rehash, but this is something a surprise move. According to Deadline, the beloved 1994 British movie is getting a TV reboot thanks to Hulu. However, it'll actually take the form of an anthology series written and executive produced by The Mindy Project's Mindy Kaling.

He plays the villainous Phoenix Buchanan, a washed-up, narcissistic actor reduced to making dog food commercials, who spots a chance to finance his one-man show by stealing an antique book. The role gives the 57-year-old Grant a chance to don a variety of absurd disguises (among them a homeless man, a nun and a bishop) in his nefarious pursuit of riches.
