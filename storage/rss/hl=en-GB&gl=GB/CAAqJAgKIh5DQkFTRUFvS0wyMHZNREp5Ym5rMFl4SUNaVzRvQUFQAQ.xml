He was frustrated with the referee. Disappointed in Floyd Mayweather Jr. Angry with Showtime's scorer. Mostly, Wilder was mad at himself. Five days later, the WBC heavyweight champion was still bothered by the way he fought in his draw with Fury on Saturday night in Los Angeles. "Fury was everything I expected him to be. It's not what Fury did, it's what I didn't do," Wilder said Thursday. "You seen the best of Fury, you didn't see the best of me.
