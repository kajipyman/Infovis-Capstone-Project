Haley as ambassador to the United Nations and help promote an “America First” foreign policy that has at times rankled some of the country’s leading allies.

Nauert, a former Fox News host with no foreign policy experience, has something in common with many of her peers in the Trump administration: a history of spreading anti-Muslim and Islamophobic comments.

The biggest piece of the shifting picture: Chief of Staff John Kelly's departure now appears certain. Trump announced Friday he was picking a new U.S. attorney genera l and a new ambassador to the U.N. , and at the same time two senior aides departed the White House to beef up his 2020 campaign.
