After weeks of repeated denials that it had anything to do with his disappearance, the kingdom eventually acknowledged that its officials were behind the gruesome murder.

Clooney, a human rights lawyer, said in a speech at the United Nations Correspondents Association Awards at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City that reporters worldwide are “under attack.” She recounted the imprisonment of journalists she represented in Myanmar, and called out “autocratic regimes” such as North Korea, the Philippines, Hungary, Turkey and Brazil for contributing to “the chilling effect” on the media. “The U.S. president has given such ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">HuffPost</source></item><item><title>US senators introduce resolution blaming MBS for Khashoggi murder - Al Jazeera English</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/senators-introduce-resolution-blaming-mbs-khashoggi-murder-181206035658278.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEAhcuDciw1qKGYk2GTZ97acqFAgEKgwIACoFCAowhgIwkDgw0O8B</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 04:55:33 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/senators-introduce-resolution-blaming-mbs-khashoggi-murder-181206035658278.html" target="_blank"&gt;US senators introduce resolution blaming MBS for Khashoggi murder&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Al Jazeera English&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six top US senators from across party lines have introduced a scathing resolution to hold the Saudi crown prince accountable for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi more than two months ago. The proposal, which was introduced on Wednesday, says the Senate "has a high level of confidence" that Mohammed bin Salman "was complicit in the murder". If approved by the Senate, it would officially condemn Prince Mohammed, also known as MBS, for the killing of Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul in October.

The prosecutor's office has concluded there is "strong suspicion" that Saud al-Qahtani and General Ahmed al-Asiri, who were both removed from their positions in October, helped plan Mr Khashoggi's October 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the officials said.
