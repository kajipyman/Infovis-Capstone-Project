When it comes to choosing which pupils to accept for a highly prized place at Oxbridge, pedigree is everything. The Sutton Trust has discovered that just eight elite secondary schools send the same number of pupils to Oxford and Cambridge as three quarters of all the other schools in the UK. Pupils from independent schools make up 42 per cent of places at Oxbridge, and are seven t..."

By contrast, some 2,900 schools and colleges, equating to three quarters of all further education centres in the UK, saw just 1,200 of their students accepted to Oxbridge in the same timeframe.

The research showed that high-flying pupils from state schools were far less likely to apply to Oxbridge than their peers in the private sector, and were less likely to be successful when they did..."
