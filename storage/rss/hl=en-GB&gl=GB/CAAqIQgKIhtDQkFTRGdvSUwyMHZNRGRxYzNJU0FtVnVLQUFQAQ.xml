He was 63. His label, Domino Records, said the cause was a heart attack. Mr. Shelley had moved to Estonia, the home country of his wife, Greta, an artist, in 2012. Mr. Shelley’s breakneck guitar strumming propelled songs that often proclaimed lovelorn vulnerability alongside acute self-consciousness. “I’m in distress, I need a caress,” he sang on one of the first Buzzcocks singles, “What Do I Get?” Buzzcocks, formed in 1976, were in Londo...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Pete Shelley wasn’t just a genius, he was a relief from the machismo of punk - The Guardian</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/07/pete-shelley-genius-1970s-punk-buzzcocks-frontman</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEB3_zYkq1Sve8iDUaCt1v0wqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTC9vBU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:12:08 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/07/pete-shelley-genius-1970s-punk-buzzcocks-frontman" target="_blank"&gt;Pete Shelley wasn’t just a genius, he was a relief from the machismo of punk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the words, isn’t it?

Pete Shelley was studying philosophy and comparative literature when he got swept up into a band, then became frontman. How could he not have been? Look at that face in those early clips.

It was the first time that people really got to see what punk was about. We were in a van from Salford Van Hire. It was the first time we’d spent more than a day away from home. That tour kickstarted people to take more of an active interest in punk, rather than just a passive one. It all happened so fast. At the bigger shows, like at Manchester’s Electric Circus, kids were ripping the seats out.
