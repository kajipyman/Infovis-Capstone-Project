Home cooked meals are still falling out of fashion and Uber Eats is proving a good way to funnel new customers into the company’s wider ecosystem of services. Uber’s hesitation is more likely connected to Deliveroo’s $4bn pricetag.

The British food delivery company will start services in the country's capital, Taipei, and then expects to roll out its app in other cities. Taiwan is the fourth Asia-Pacific market Deliveroo has entered, after Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, and chief executive Will Shu said the move was a "personal milestone", given his parents were born in Taiwan and many of his family members still live in the country.

In a statement, Foodora said the reason for its Australian closure was to "shift [its] focus towards other markets where the company currently sees a higher potential for growth". The company has been competing against rivals including Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Foodora said it would ensure that its employees, "support partners" and contractors found "suitable alternative roles". "I feel weird… this is nice news.
