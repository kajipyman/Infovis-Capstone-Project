For over a decade, the British media has desperately courted him, from disproportionately covering his party’s activities, to making him one of this century’s most regular Question Time guests.

Evans, Ukip’s deputy chair between 2014 and 2017, said she was unwilling to “turn a blind eye” to attempts by leader Gerard Batten and far-right activist Tommy Robinson to orchestrate “a Momentum-style takeover” of the party – a reference to the Labour grassroots movement supporting Jeremy Corbyn. “I joined Ukip because it was a Brexit party, and because I wanted a referendum on our EU membership,” she said in a statement posted on Fa...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk">HuffPost UK</source></item><item><title>Tommy Robinson's Australia tour postponed after anti-Islam activist plans Brexit protest on same date - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tommy-robinson-latest-australia-tour-postponed-brexit-protest-march-islam-edl-court-a8653821.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEtG1gXctOp89T-bO96TdC4qFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCtyxU</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 11:43:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tommy-robinson-latest-australia-tour-postponed-brexit-protest-march-islam-edl-court-a8653821.html" target="_blank"&gt;Tommy Robinson's Australia tour postponed after anti-Islam activist plans Brexit protest on same date&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tommy Robinson’s planned speaking tour of Australia has been postponed after he planned a Brexit protest on the same date.

That cheery Eurosceptic rabble led by Nigel Farage? Ever since the UK opted for Brexit, the party collapsed in on itself— consumed by self-loathing in a desperate search for purpose. While its most notable leader went off to become a transatlantic media pundit, Ukip went through a succession of abysmal leaders who have struggled to make headway.
