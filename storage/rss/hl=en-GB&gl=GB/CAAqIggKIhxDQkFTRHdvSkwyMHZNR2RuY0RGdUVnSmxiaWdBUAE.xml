(Kevin Winter/Getty Images)Getty Images “Oscar host has become the least wanted job in Hollywood,” The Hollywood Reporter argued in a piece published earlier this week. Then Kevin Hart took that job. His old, homophobic tweets resurfaced, sparking outrage and, according to Hart, an ultimatum from the Academy: Apologize or step aside. He initially refused to do the former and eventually bowed out. “I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists,” Hart tweeted Friday morning. “I sincerely apologize ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.washingtonpost.com">The Washington Post</source></item><item><title>‘The View’ Defends Kevin Hart: ‘How Many Times Does He Need to Apologize?’ - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-view-defends-kevin-hart-how-many-times-does-he-need-to-apologize</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEIGqWVTwvqP7ZpU5JO3hCGAqFQgEKg0IACoGCAow7s8BMNBIMPGMAg</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-view-defends-kevin-hart-how-many-times-does-he-need-to-apologize" target="_blank"&gt;‘The View’ Defends Kevin Hart: ‘How Many Times Does He Need to Apologize?’&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;The View/Screenshot This week, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Kevin Hart an ultimatum: Apologize for your history of making homophobic jokes or you will be removed as host of the 2019 Oscars. “I chose to pass on the apology,” Hart told fans in an Instagram video. “The reason why I passed is because I’ve addressed this several times.” He put the ball in The Academy’s court, but an hour later, he tweeted that the was stepping down as host, offering that long-awaited apology in the end. “I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past,” ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.thedailybeast.com">The Daily Beast</source></item><item><title>Kevin Hart Steps Down As Oscars Host Just Two Days After Being Announced Following 'Homophobic Tweets' Controversy - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/kevin-hart-oscars-host-2019-homophobic-tweets_uk_5c0a2264e4b0de79357b7413</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEKuDcQl4mUmUx9eJw8jrIqYqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowmdW_BzCbhUcw-vd4</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 07:54:49 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/kevin-hart-oscars-host-2019-homophobic-tweets_uk_5c0a2264e4b0de79357b7413" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Hart Steps Down As Oscars Host Just Two Days After Being Announced Following 'Homophobic Tweets' Controversy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;HuffPost UK&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hart has stood down from helming next year’s Oscars, just two days after he was announced as the host.

Shortly after he announced he would be hosting the 91st annual Academy Awards, comedian Kevin Hart stepped down after an entirely predictable kerfuffle over homophobic tweets and jokes.

Capping a swift and dramatic fallout, Hart wrote on Twitter just after midnight Thursday that he was withdrawing as Oscars host because he didn't want to be a distraction. "I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past," wrote Hart.

In what was perhaps the most avoidable public relations disaster of the year, the comedian and actor was tapped as host of the Oscars earlier this week only to step down last night (Dec. 7) in the wake of widespread backlash over his history of homophobic comments. Hart’s ouster came only 72 hours after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced him as the pick.
