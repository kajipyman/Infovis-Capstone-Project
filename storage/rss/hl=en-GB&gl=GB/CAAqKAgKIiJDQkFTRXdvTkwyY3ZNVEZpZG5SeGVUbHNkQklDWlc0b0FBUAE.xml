Holding, who has started 11 of Arsenal’s last 13 matches in all competitions, considered leaving the club on loan this summer. But Arsenal instead decided to allow Calum Chambers to join Fulham this season, allowing Holding an opportunity to impress following the arrival of Emery as head coach. “In pre-season, every player had chances to show us how they play and little by little, with his work every day, I think Rob Holding is im...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.telegraph.co.uk">The Telegraph</source></item><item><title>Vorskla Poltava vs Arsenal: Young Gunners ease their way to Europa League victory to top group - The Independent</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/vorskla-poltava-vs-arsenal-result-score-goals-highlights-europa-league-2018-a8660071.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMFk_WoX7RIUU5CEk6wAv7QqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTC8yxU</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:06:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/vorskla-poltava-vs-arsenal-result-score-goals-highlights-europa-league-2018-a8660071.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vorskla Poltava vs Arsenal: Young Gunners ease their way to Europa League victory to top group&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Independent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenal secured top spot in their Europa League group as a much-changed side coasted to a 3-0 Europa League victory against Vorskla Poltava in sub-zero Kiev. The Group E fixture was moved 185 miles east of Poltava to the capital's Olympic Stadium, with parts of Ukraine under martial law as political tensions with Russia continue to rise. The call to relocate the game was made on Tuesday evening, with Vorskla particularly unhappy with UEFA's decision and official confirmation that the match would take place at all not coming from the governing body until six hours before kick-off.

Unai Emery and his re-energerised team have built momentum and belief during the sequence, although they had not been able to beat a Big Six Premier League rival. That changed on a wild afternoon in north London when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continued his dead-eyed scoring exploits and Arsenal fought back from 2-1 down to register yet another come-from-behind win.

The NSC Olimpiyskiy will host Thursday’s encounter Arsenal’s place in the knockout stage has already been guaranteed, so they take on Vorskla with nothing serious on the line.

Dier celebrated in front of the Arsenal substitutes after his equalising goal at 1-1 and it escalated quickly, with both sets of players and benches becoming involved in a huge melee. Pochettino himself sprinted down the touchline to play peacemaker and the Football Association has charged both clubs with failing to control their players.

If the Arsenal head coach has shown one thing since arriving in north London, it is that he is not afraid to make bold decisions, and here was another one: Mesut Ozil had been dropped to the bench, and Arsenal were going to play with a back three. It was only the second time that Emery has so drastically changed his shape this season.
