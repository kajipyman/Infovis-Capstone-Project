The Nobel prizewinner sent it to religious philosopher Eric Gutkind in response to Gutkind’s book, “Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt.” An agent for the unnamed buyer obtained the letter on Tuesday following a vigorous 4-minute competition that saw the price rise to nearly twice Sotheby’s highest prediction of $1.5 million.

Albert Einstein's 1954 letter to religious philosopher Erik Gutkind is commonly referred to as the "God letter," and it features Einstein politely but very thoroughly roasting the concept of religion and God in general.

The problem with dark matter and dark energy is that they are “dark.” Normal matter—the stuff that makes the stars and planets, for example—can be seen.

Slow, but long-lived. It’s a metaphor. The game of science isn’t a sprint. We don’t leap from discovery to discovery, constantly rewriting our knowledge and overhauling long-held beliefs at a moment’s notice. Sure, science is a process of continual, never-ending updates, but it’s a slow, gradual exercise that creaks and groans forward through the years, decades, and even centuries. If a headline is telling you that a major new discovery will completely change our paradigms, it’s probably wrong.

Or, you could measure the vibrations of an atom. That’s what scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Maryland have done, creating two clocks that each trap 1,000 atoms of the element ytterbium in grids of lasers. These lasers are able to measure the atoms’ vibrations with near-perfect accuracy (there’s roughly one billionth of a billionth chance of error.)

Studies of the brain’s anatomy also show, on average, that there are structural differences in the brains of women and men, but the variation between individuals is far larger than that between the sexes – in other words, there is no such thing as a “female” or “male” brain.

The most powerful of these waves occur when objects move very quickly, for instance when two big stars orbit each other or two black holes orbit one another and merge.
