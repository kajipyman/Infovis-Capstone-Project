Deval Patrick of Massachusetts will soon announce he won't launch a 2020 presidential campaign, according to three sources familiar with his plans. They did not say why he decided against a run. A formal announcement was delayed as the country observed a day of mourning for President George H.W. Bush, one source said. News of Patrick's plans was first reported by Politico.

Charlie Baker said Wednesday that he hadn't decided if he would vote for fellow Republican and U.S. Senate candidate Geoff Diehl even though he has publicly endorsed his candidacy — but quickly backtracked and pledged to cast a ballot for Diehl. Baker made the statement during his second televised debate with Democratic challenger Jay Gonzalez. Baker said he decided to back the state's Republican ticket which includes Diehl, who co-chaired President Donald Trump's 2016 Massachusetts presidential campaign.

The party struggled with its identity and direction. The party still couldn't agree on what happened. Was a Vermont progressive who'd lost the primary the new, more viable direction for the party? It was then that Deval Patrick decided he would get out of the private sector, back into politics, and run for executive office. In 2018, Democrats face many of the same questions.
