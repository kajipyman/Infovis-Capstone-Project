In the endless speculation about the direction of the investigation, a common view was that maybe the investigation would never implicate President Trump or find any collusion.

And what Trump saw has to terrify him. What was on display -- in sentencing documents for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and a memo detailing how one-time Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort broke the terms of his plea agreement -- was the depth and breadth of what Mueller and his team are investigating, what they already know and just how close they are to the President himself.

With special counsel Robert Mueller wrapping up the investigation of President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and noting in a heavily-redacted court filing that he has been of "substantial assistance" to the Russia investigation following his plea agreement, many in Trump's inner circle may be fearful of what will happen next in the probe.

Just a few days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller recommended as little as no prison time for Trump's former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who pled guilty to lying to the FBI and had agreed to cooperate with the FBI, moments ago US prosecutors issued a statement in which they announced that Michael Cohen, who infamously flipped on the president (for whom Cohen once said he "would take a bullet") deserves "substantial prison time", despite his cooperation.

In the sentencing memo filed against President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor, the special counsel emphasized Flynn’s timeliness as an important factor for the court to consider in fashioning his sentence for pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. The currency of criminal investigations is cooperators. And early cooperation enhances the investigation in two important ways. First, early cooperation leads to more cooperators.
