(Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/REX)EPA The Republican Party’s relationship with black voters has been as cold as ice for decades. No GOP presidential candidate has won the black vote since 1965, when the Voting Rights Act made it illegal to put barriers in place aimed at suppressing the black vote.

Former President George H.W. Bush was remembered at his funeral on Wednesday as a “kinder and gentler” leader who steered the country through storms at home and abroad.

Unlike Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Jeff Sessions’s former chief of staff and a troubling interim replacement in more ways than one, Mr. Barr is intimately familiar with the nation’s chief law enforcement agency, having served as President George H.W.

(AP) — Changes made to absentee voting procedures five years ago in North Carolina may have emboldened workers to run the type of illegal "ballot-harvesting" operation alleged to have been used in a disputed congressional race, election experts and lawmakers said. Some observers are concerned that the changes made it possible for more people to apply for absentee ballots. Then so-called harvesters could collect unsealed ballots and manipulate them or throw out ones from minority voters who might have otherwise gone to the polls.

(AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that Congress should provide all the money he wants for his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, and he called illegal immigration a "threat to the well-being of every American community." Trump spoke hours after signing a short-term spending bill that covers key government departments for two more weeks, until Dec. 21, setting up a pre-Christmas showdown over the wall. The president wants the next spending package to include at least $5 billion for the proposed wall.

If confirmed by the Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who has been serving in an acting capacity since Trump forced out Jeffrey Sessions a month ago. Whitaker had been Sessions' chief of staff.
