Since mid-October, thousands of Central Americans, mostly from Honduras, have traveled north through Mexico in a caravan, some walking much of the long trek. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to stop the migrants, sending troops to reinforce the border and attempting a procedural change, so far denied by the courts, to require asylum-seekers to remain in ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>New York Court Tells CBP Agent He's Not Allowed To Pretend He's A Traffic Cop - Techdirt</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181125/09223141099/new-york-court-tells-cbp-agent-hes-not-allowed-to-pretend-hes-traffic-cop.shtml</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPoOIniZWKtBQNRLdO3Upz0qFAgEKg0IACoGCAow2o0BMMAdMNhK</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 23:32:28 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181125/09223141099/new-york-court-tells-cbp-agent-hes-not-allowed-to-pretend-hes-traffic-cop.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;New York Court Tells CBP Agent He's Not Allowed To Pretend He's A Traffic Cop&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Techdirt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short decision, the Supreme Court of the State of New York reminds federal agents what they can and can't do while operating under the color of law. In this case (via The Newspaper) a CBP officer, who was supposed to be keeping an eye on the ultra-dangerous Canadians, decided he wanted to be a traffic cop instead. Spotting a driver "engaging in dangerous maneuvers," the CBP agent (who is unnamed in the decision) decided to pursue the vehicle. He called the Buffalo (New York) Police Department to relay his observations. Deciding it would take too long for Buffalo PD officers to respond ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.techdirt.com">Techdirt</source></item><item><title>Video shows migrant kids dropped over Arizona border fence - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children/video-shows-migrant-kids-dropped-over-arizona-border-fence-idUSKBN1O4082</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHdRnCg7JJIip6DzGFEI0-MqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMJSCDg</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 02:44:12 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children/video-shows-migrant-kids-dropped-over-arizona-border-fence-idUSKBN1O4082" target="_blank"&gt;Video shows migrant kids dropped over Arizona border fence&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video showing young children being dropped by a suspected smuggler from an 18-foot (5.5-meter) border fence in Arizona into the arms of their family was released by U.S. Border Patrol on Monday. The Yuma, Arizona sector of the U.S.-Mexico border has seen a sharp rise in illegal entries by migrant families as authorities tighten controls at Tijuana and Mexicali border crossings to the west with the arrival of a Central American immigrant caravan. The video showed the suspected smuggler helping adults from a Guatemalan family climb the fence then dropping their 2-year-old and 7-year-old chi...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>Risking "Certain Detention", Caravan Migrants Breach US Border - Zero Hedge</title><link>https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-12-04/well-figure-it-out-caravan-migrants-breach-us-border</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEG_j3SD87zP91eSODgk_3uYqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowxIEBMKAYMNk_</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:40:54 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-12-04/well-figure-it-out-caravan-migrants-breach-us-border" target="_blank"&gt;Risking "Certain Detention", Caravan Migrants Breach US Border&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Zero Hedge&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weeks now, members of one of the migrant caravans that traveled from Honduras all the way to the southern border of the US have been stuck in a squalid camp in Tijuana as they await their chance to declare asylum, or otherwise cross the border. But after weeks of waiting - a period that has been marred by violent attacks on border patrol agents and skirmishes with US forces - some have decided that crossing the border to declare asylum in defiance of President Trump's orders is probably the best course of action, according to Reuters. These migrants risk "almost certain detention."

California authorities say one woman and two men were killed in the crash Thursday afternoon on westbound Interstate 8 in Campo. Another eight men who were also in the pickup were injured in the crash about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of San Diego.

The family, which hailed from Guatemala, managed to scale the barrier on Monday near the San Luis Port in Arizona along the 27-mile Yuma Sector of the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement. After two adult family members were helped over the wall from the Mexican side by another migrant, the children—aged two, seven and 10—were dropped to be caught below.
