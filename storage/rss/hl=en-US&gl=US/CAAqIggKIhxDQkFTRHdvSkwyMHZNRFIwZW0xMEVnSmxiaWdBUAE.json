But the deal includes no concrete commitments, deep divisions remain and a staunch China skeptic, Robert Lighthizer, will lead the American negotiating team. \u2022 Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, went to Ecuador in 2017 to talk to the incoming president about Chinese investment.
