(Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) CNN is tired of all the statements. The network issued its umpteenth condemnation of the Trump White House last week, after it learned that Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta would have to work without a hard pass, which Trump officials had invalidated over an incident at a post-midterms news conference. Here’s how it was worded: Tonight the White House revoked @Acosta’s press pass.

The story should have made clear that the Marine Corps and White House Military Office make the determination to ground the president's helicopter due to bad weather.
