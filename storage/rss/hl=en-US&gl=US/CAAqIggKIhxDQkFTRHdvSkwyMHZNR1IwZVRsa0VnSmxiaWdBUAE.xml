The first major presidential campaign announcements could come before year's end. The Democratic National Committee plans to announce a debate framework by then featuring 15 to 20 candidates. The first primary debate could happen as early as May, a full three months before the premiere debate of the 2016 cycle. And long-rumored White House hopefuls are already bowing out.

After losing by less than two points to Ted Cruz in a race experts once thought would be a blowout in favor of the Republican, many supporters are now calling on O’Rourke to mount a run for president in 2020. As the Washington Post noted, O’Rourke may also have the support of Barack Obama. “The meeting, which was held on Nov. 16 at the former president’s offices in Foggy Bottom, came as former Obama aides have encouraged the Democratic House member to run, seeing...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.inquisitr.com">The Inquisitr News</source></item><item><title>Starting to Look a Lot Like Christmas - Power Line</title><link>https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2018/12/starting-to-look-a-lot-like-christmas.php</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEBqYLzG5ixloI5fJXxCV4KYqFAgEKg0IACoGCAow04UBMPAaMNZC</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 17:37:12 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2018/12/starting-to-look-a-lot-like-christmas.php" target="_blank"&gt;Starting to Look a Lot Like Christmas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Power Line&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Steven Hayward) Want some holiday cheer, especially after the dispiriting mid-term elections?

Bush was arguably the most prepared man to become president, and then, as president, oversaw the end of the Cold War and a successful removal of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. His reward for all of this success was losing reelection to a young governor bringing (you guessed it) generational change. (The poor timing of an economic recession didn’t help matters.)

The Associated Press reports thatSanders is "laying the groundwork to launch a bigger presidential campaign than his first."

Julian Castro, a secretary of Housing and Urban Development under former President Barack Obama, says he's likely to run, while Rep. Beto O'Rourke isn't ruling out a bid, either.
