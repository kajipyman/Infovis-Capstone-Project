In their last argument before a monthlong holiday recess, the justices debated whether to overturn the decades-old “separate sovereigns” doctrine, which lets a state and the U.S. government press separate prosecutions involving the same conduct. The doctrine is an exception to the constitutional ban on double jeopardy.

That's the question at the heart of a case that gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to reconsider a longstanding but misbegotten exception to the constitutional ban on double jeopardy.
