In addressing Congress the next day, President Roosevelt called it “a date which will live in infamy.” But Roosevelt’s reputation should live in infamy too. The line that Roosevelt enthusiasts and left-wing historians have peddled for so many years is that the attack was a complete surprise.

Abe is not expected to apologize for Japan’s 1941 attack, which killed more than 2,000 Americans and temporarily crippled the U.S. Pacific fleet. But his visit was cast as a gesture of reconciliation matching President Barack Obama’s trip to Hiroshima earlier in the year, when the American president likewise stopped short of apologizing for the use of an atomic bomb on the city.

Often given less than 24 hours to leave their homes and farms with “only what they could carry,” families who lived in the newly defined “military zone” on the West coast were rounded up, forced to forfeit their property, and moved to camps with barbed wire and machine gun-armed guard towers overseen by the United States Army. Plans were drawn up using guidelines for prisoners of war.
