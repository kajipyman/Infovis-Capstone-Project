With historically low unemployment rates, better than expected GDP growth, low inflation, and the deep Republican tax cuts, why weren’t voters more grateful to the incumbent party? One guess is discomfort with President Donald Trump—and by association the Republicans. But that isn’t enough of an explanation. Despite the strong economy, voters worry the economy and Republicans will harm their retirement security.

Is it possible that all that effort actually nudged us forward a bit? Because the votes were counted so slowly across the country, we were also slow to realize that Democrats had won the national congressional vote by a margin greater than that of the Tea Party Republicans in 2010. In fact, Democrats overcame huge structural hurdles to win nearly 40 seats. At first, the results looked like something of a stalemate.
