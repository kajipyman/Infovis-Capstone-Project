He even might consider doing some TV! So obviously the only thing to do now is speculate on where he\u2019s going to coach next. USC? Notre Dame? Auburn? North Dakota State??? This morning\u2019s Yahoo Sports report (Meyer-sympathetic enough to safely assume it\u2019s coming from Meyer himself) says Meyer will coach one last game for Ohio State, the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl against Washington, bef..."

Ryan Day was named as Meyer's successor at Ohio State. He's been with the program for two seasons as an offensive coordinator.

When player compensation scandals drove him from the job, the Buckeyes secured Urban Meyer, who immediately went 12-0 in his first season, never lost to Michigan, and led the program to a national championship in year three.

Meyer announced the move earlier Tuesday following a rocky 2018 campaign. The coach was suspended for the first three games of the regular season after an investigation found he did not do enough to report allegations of domestic violence against former assistant coach Zach Smith.

Back then, in 2010, he walked away from a program cratered with entitlement run amok, roster manipulation, a drug problem in the locker room and more than 30 player arrests in six seasons. On Tuesday, he walked away from a program that has had a brutal season off the ..."
