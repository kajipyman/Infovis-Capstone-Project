It wasn't long ago that a wearing a fur coat was an emblem of conspicuous consumption, a wealth signifier and status symbol that many regarded as distinguished, rather than distasteful. In 2017 and 2018, several luxury brands (as well as retailers, magazines, fashion weeks and even entire cities) have pledged to go fur-free and ban fur sales — Gucci, Burberry, Versace and Michael Kors among them — after decades of concerted efforts on behalf of animal welfare organizations.
