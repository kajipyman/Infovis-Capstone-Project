Haley as ambassador to the United Nations and help promote an “America First” foreign policy that has at times rankled some of the country’s leading allies.

Haley said the missile test was "provocative" and urged the international community not to keep "turning a blind eye every time Iran blatan...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.voanews.com">VOA News</source></item><item><title>Trump confirms he will nominate William Barr as attorney general and Heather Nauert as UN ambassador - Salon</title><link>https://www.salon.com/2018/12/07/trump-confirms-he-will-nominate-william-barr-as-attorney-general-and-heather-nauert-as-un-ambassador/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEQMbKQnXxOth3vL_9IkLvQqFAgEKgsIACoFCAowgGAwADDklYsG</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 15:52:09 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/12/07/trump-confirms-he-will-nominate-william-barr-as-attorney-general-and-heather-nauert-as-un-ambassador/" target="_blank"&gt;Trump confirms he will nominate William Barr as attorney general and Heather Nauert as UN ambassador&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Salon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikimedia/Getty/Mandel Ngan President Donald Trump confirmed his picks to fill top Cabinet posts on Friday, announcing that he would nominate William Barr to be his next attorney general and Heather Nauert to be his next ambassador to the United Nations. If confirmed for a second gig as attorney general, Barr could soon oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the alleged collusion between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Barr previously served as attorney general to the late former President George H. W. Bush from 1991 to 1993.

(Reuters) Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, accused Russia on Monday of taking “outlaw actions” against Ukrainian ships in an incident at sea this weekend and vowed that sanctions punishing Russia’s annexation of Crimea would continue.

Top story: Bolton says he knew of arrest in advance The fallout from the arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou continues to rock the political and financial worlds, with the Chinese media accusing the US of a “despicable” effort to curb the growth of the telecoms giant. Meng is due in court in Vancouver on Friday; she faces extradition to the US on charges of cyber-espionage and sanctions-busting, which Huawei has firmly denied. The US national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Thursday he had advance knowledge of Meng’...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</source></item><item><title>Trump to Pick Nauert to Replace Haley as UN Ambassador, Sources Say - Bloomberg</title><link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-07/trump-is-said-to-pick-nauert-to-replace-haley-as-un-ambassador</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPDK612QmO-ZzZbQgFqa0dUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow4uzwCjCF3bsCMK3JrwM</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 00:45:07 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-07/trump-is-said-to-pick-nauert-to-replace-haley-as-un-ambassador" target="_blank"&gt;Trump to Pick Nauert to Replace Haley as UN Ambassador, Sources Say&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has settled on State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to replace departing United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, according to three people familiar with the matter. Nauert, 48, is an unusual choice for the UN role given that she had little experience in government or foreign policy before joining the administration in April 2017 after several years as an anchor and correspondent for Fox News, including on the “Fox and Friends” show watched by Trump.

Ms. Nauert, a former Fox News anchor who has served as the public face of the State Department since last year, would replace Nikki R.

He said he will nominate William Barr, who was attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush in the 1990s, to fill that top job again at the U.S. Justice Department.
