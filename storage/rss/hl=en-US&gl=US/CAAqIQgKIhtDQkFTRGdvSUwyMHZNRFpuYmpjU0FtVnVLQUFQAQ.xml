To those who have been watching the Mueller investigation unfold, the implications of the deal seemed clear: Manafort was going to flip on Trump, and help Mueller get to the bottom of whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election.

There are at least three fronts of recent activity: the Paul Manafort front, the Jerome Corsi/Roger Stone front, and the Michael Cohen front. Let’s discuss them in turn with a focus on implications for President Trump. On the Manafort front, Mueller has nullified the plea deal.

Felix Sater, who at the time was a “senior adviser” to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, also downplayed its significance, calling it a mere marketing concept in an early stage of the project. “This was a marketing conversation.
