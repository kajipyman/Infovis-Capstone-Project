The singer posted a lengthy Instagram message to the award-winning actress, addressing the recent controversy. In an interview with USA Today, Natalie Portman opened up about her experiences growing up in the entertainment industry. The actress, who plays a fictional pop star in her latest film, Vox Lux, discussed the conflicting messages put out by the music industry — and how they had a profound impact on her growing up. “I remember being a teenager, and there was Jessi...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.inquisitr.com">The Inquisitr News</source></item><item><title>‘I’m Sorry!’ Natalie Portman Apologizes To Jessica Simpson After Sex Shame Scandal - Radar Online</title><link>https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2018/12/natalie-portman-apologizes-jessica-simpson-sex-shaming-feud/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENsA1Bd1zIApuWI6_S0KuEIqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowtbRxMMGeDzDGoZgD</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 21:43:31 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2018/12/natalie-portman-apologizes-jessica-simpson-sex-shaming-feud/" target="_blank"&gt;‘I’m Sorry!’ Natalie Portman Apologizes To Jessica Simpson After Sex Shame Scandal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Radar Online&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry! Natalie Portman is clarifying her words about Jessica Simpson that caused her to clap back after she seemingly sex shamed the singer in a recent interview where she said she was “confused” as a girl when she saw the then-virgin buxom blonde’s bikini shoot. “Thank you for your words,” Portman said in reply to Simpson on social media. “I completely agree with you that a woman should be allowed to dress however she likes and behave however she likes and not be judged.

Jessica Simpson has taken exception to something Natalie Portman has said about her. Here's how it all went down: Portman's been making the rounds promoting her new film, "Vox Lux," about a teen who becomes a pop star after a song she writes honoring a tragedy goes viral. The 37-year-old actress plays the adult version of the character, who ages through the course of the film. Portman mentioned Simpson in an interview with USA Today.

Over the weekend, the singer-turned-fashion mogul shared a behind-the-scenes photo from picture day on Instagram, in which her kiddos show off big smiles for the camera. They look utterly angelic. “Behind the scenes of school pictures...seriously?!?!?” Simpson captioned the sweet photo. “Thank you God for these precious kiddos.” If only we were this good at picture day when we were little...

Having browbeaten Kelly Clarkson for feeding her kid Nutella and scolded Kate Beckinsale for going out without her (legal adult) daughter, our beloved parenting experts have moved on to Jessica Simpson. Why? Because she posted a photo of her 5-year-old daughter Maxwell wearing a bikini and jutting out her hip for the camera. Ironically, the former pop star seemed to be sharing a message about the importance of kids wearing bike helmets, captioning the pic "safety first." Many of her Instagram followers, however, fixated on Maxwell's outfit and pos...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="http://www.refinery29.com">Refinery29</source></item><item><title>Jessica Simpson Is Not Pregnant With Her Third Child [Debunked] - The Inquisitr News</title><link>http://www.inquisitr.com/3804759/jessica-simpson-is-not-pregnant-with-her-third-child-debunked/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEC8UCcUsS1PYcaRkMn6w3-gqGAgEKg8IACoHCAow2NCfCTChqm8wgsagAQ</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2016 14:54:32 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3804759/jessica-simpson-is-not-pregnant-with-her-third-child-debunked/" target="_blank"&gt;Jessica Simpson Is Not Pregnant With Her Third Child [Debunked]&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Inquisitr News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Simpson may have had a case of baby fever on social media, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that she’s pregnant with her third child. The tabloids were quick to point out that the fashion designer was pregnant yet again and it could save her alleged troubled marriage to Eric Johnson. A new report in Radar Online claims that Simpson is finally pregnant with baby No. 3 after she “has been in baby making mode for months” and she was recently spotted having not having a drink during an “unusually teetotal dining” experience.

Will a boy bander take the title? Or maybe, as is often the case, a former athlete will shimmy to victory. Here’s a look at the competitors.

Photograph by Neilson Barnard/ Getty It’s no secret that sex has tons of health benefits, from pain relief to sounder sleep. You’ve probably also heard that feeling confident about your bod can boost your pleasure in the bedroom. But does it work the other way too—can having sex actually improve our self-confidence? Well, apparently, Jessica Simpson says it works for her. In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, the 36-year-old singer-turned-fashion-entrepreneur revealed her secret to feeling great about her body is “Sex.” That's it.

Between the silky vocals and the fun choreography — not to mention Lachey's love connection with Jessica Simpson — fans everywhere simply couldn't get enough of the tribal-tattooed quartet. Though the group may no longer receive the same amount of buzz that they did back in their heyday, there is one way that former fans lovingly keep the guys in their thoughts every summer: by sharing memes on hotter-than-Hades days.
