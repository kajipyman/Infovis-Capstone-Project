Lyft Inc. publicly filed confidentially on Thursday. That is to say, Lyft blasted out a press release telling the world that it sent the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission its financial documents without sharing the information publicly. Announcing that secret step to the world is not unheard of but not typical, either. It’s fitting that Lyft is trying to create as much fanfare as it can, because part of the company’s goal with this initial public offering is to draw attention away from Uber Technologies Inc.

Uber has been there. Tesla has been there. And now a self-driving car from the Google self-driving subsidiary has been involved in an accident on the open road. (Though, to be fair, in Waymo's case the incident was far less serious than those other deadly crashes, and was caused not by Waymo's software but instead a human driver who veered into the path of an oncoming motorcyclist.)

On Dec. 5, Waymo, the driverless car company spun out of Alphabet neé Google, unveiled a commercial ride-hail service, Waymo One, in the greater metro area of Phoenix, Arizona. While it’s far from a robotaxi takeover, hundreds of pre-approved riders in greater Phoenix can now book and pay for a ride in a driverless taxi using Waymo’s technology. Waymo One is in every way a competitor to Uber.

When the driver didn’t respond, the cops went beyond their standard playbook.
