In the words of the New York Times, which on Thursday detailed how Warren is still trying to figure out how to respond to the multi-faceted criticism over her rollout of the DNA results and an accompanying 6-minute video, “the lingering cloud over her likely presidential campaign has only darkened.” In my words: everyone’s still wondering, what the fuck was she thinking?

The US Senate voted to confirm Kathy Kraninger as the next head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the federal government’s top consumer watchdog. If you haven’t heard of her don’t worry — before she was tapped to head the agency, neither had pretty much anyone else.
