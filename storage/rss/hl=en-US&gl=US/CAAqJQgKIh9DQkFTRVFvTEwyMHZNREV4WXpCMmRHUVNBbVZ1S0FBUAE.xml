Really bummed. We got Ray J at Craig's in WeHo Wednesday night and wanted to get his take on hip-hop's huge news earlier this week after Cardi broke things off with Offset amid allegations he cheated and tried setting up a threesome with a Cardi wannabe. Ray J -- who earlier that evening hit up the Lakers game -- hopes Cardi and Offset get back together because he's adamant they belong together. Our guy also straight-up asks Ray J how bad of a look it is for Offset to try a...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.tmz.com">TMZ</source></item><item><title>Cardi B Makes First Public Appearance Since Offset Breakup At Art Basel - The Inquisitr News</title><link>https://www.inquisitr.com/5196893/cardi-b-makes-first-public-appearance-since-offset-breakup-at-art-basel/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiELjvfBZEzC27K2yRjuchMeQqGAgEKg8IACoHCAow2NCfCTChqm8wgsagAQ</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 16:31:36 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5196893/cardi-b-makes-first-public-appearance-since-offset-breakup-at-art-basel/" target="_blank"&gt;Cardi B Makes First Public Appearance Since Offset Breakup At Art Basel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Inquisitr News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardi B took a break from the drama of her split with husband Offset for a little dancing and music in Miami.
