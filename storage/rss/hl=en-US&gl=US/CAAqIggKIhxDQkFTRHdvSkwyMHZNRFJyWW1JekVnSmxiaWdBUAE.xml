The minute Ohio State suspended Urban Meyer on August 22nd, this was over. It was over because Meyer and the university could no longer fully trust each other, and because Meyer was dragged through the humiliation of being subservient to a school, rather than to football itself. Once the coach’s football interests became secondary to the institution’s, Meyer’s departure was set in motion. 2. That much should have been clear on October 30th, when Meyer began to talk publicly about his headaches caused by...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.sbnation.com">SB Nation</source></item><item><title>Ryan Day, ‘quarterback guru,’ to take over for Urban Meyer at Ohio State - The Washington Post</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/12/04/ryan-day-quarterback-guru-take-over-urban-meyer-ohio-state/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEJHhsmd6zlAwEL2dHjXzXA8qGAgEKg8IACoHCAowjtSUCjC30XQwmdHlAQ</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 18:12:48 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/12/04/ryan-day-quarterback-guru-take-over-urban-meyer-ohio-state/" target="_blank"&gt;Ryan Day, ‘quarterback guru,’ to take over for Urban Meyer at Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Day led Ohio State to a 3-0 record as interim coach this season. (Jay LaPrete/Associated Press)Associated Press In January, Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer gave Ryan Day a big bump in salary and a new title, moves that kept him so happy he reportedly turned down the Mississippi State head coaching position and the offensive coordinator position offered by the Tennessee Titans. Less than a year later, Day’s patience will have paid off: The 39-year-old will take control of one of the nation’s elite college football programs upon Meyer’s retirement following the Rose Bowl, a move that was an...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.washingtonpost.com">The Washington Post</source></item><item><title>Urban Meyer Resigns, You Know The Drill - Deadspin</title><link>https://deadspin.com/urban-meyer-resigns-you-know-the-drill-1830845627</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEPzVkYtPr12hew1PhUS5jB8qFggEKg0IACoGCAowpIACMJBMMP3SsAE</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 13:18:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://deadspin.com/urban-meyer-resigns-you-know-the-drill-1830845627" target="_blank"&gt;Urban Meyer Resigns, You Know The Drill&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Deadspin&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo: Joe Robbins (Getty) Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but Urban Meyer is stepping down from his head coaching gig, in part because of his health and in part because he wants to spend more time with family. He even might consider doing some TV! So obviously the only thing to do now is speculate on where he’s going to coach next. USC? Notre Dame? Auburn? North Dakota State???

Speaking to TMZ Sports, Wilson noted schools like Oklahoma and Notre Dame attempted to lure him away from Columbus. "If Coach [Ryan] Day is going to be leading the team, then I'm going to be there right beside him," Wilson said. Ryan Day was named as Meyer's successor at Ohio State.

The 21st century has been good for Ohio State football. 2001 was the inaugural season for Jim Tressel, who made good quickly with a win over rival Michigan and a national championship the following year. When player compensation scandals drove him from the job, the Buckeyes secured Urban Meyer, who immediately went 12-0 in his first season, never lost to Michigan, and led the program to a national championship in year three.

In the long history of the Red River Rivalry, this marks the first time Oklahoma and Texas have played twice in the same season. The fifth-ranked Sooners not only got revenge for their only defeat this season, but they are also in prime position for a spot in the College Football Playoff.

"I believe I will not coach again," Meyer said at a press conference that doubled as his retirement presser and Ryan Day's introduction. Meyer announced the move earlier Tuesday following a rocky 2018 campaign.

We'll get through this shocking revelation, this can't-be-true moment, together. Urban Meyer has retired. Again. Meyer proclaimed Tuesday that he's leaving Ohio State because of health issues, and that he's done coaching. It's the same thing he said eight years ago after walking away from Florida. Back then, in 2010, he walked away from a program cratered with entitlement run amok, roster manipulation, a drug problem in the locker room and more than 30 player arrests in six seasons. On Tuesday, he walked away from a program that has had a brutal season off the ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</source></item></channel></rss>
