It will mark Oh and Samberg's first time co-hosting together, but it will not be their first time appearing on a big stage side by side.

Oh and Samberg presented together at the 2018 Emmys and came through with one of the night’s better comedic offerings.

As far as 2018 was concerned, these stars pretty much came out on top. Killing Eve rocketed Oh back into the spotlight, and earned her an Emmy nod for her performance as the titular character. Brooklyn Nine-Nine also made headlines after Fox had cancelled the show — fans were immediately distraught, and NBC swooped in to save it.

While Webber explains how surgeons spend their lives preparing for the worst, he receives a message from Catherine that she will remain in Los Angeles for another day. In addition to overseeing renovations of the Catherine Fox Medical Center, she asks Tom and Meredith to join her for a special project.

This season has already been a journey with Teddy's (Kim Raver) baby news, Alex (Justin Chambers) taking the reins as Chief, and Meredith's (Ellen Pompeo) love life heating up. But, this week's death-themed episode titled “Flowers Grow Out of My Grave,” proves we've still got a long way to go. So let's get on with the trek...err, updates. Less than five minutes in, Teddy shows up at Owen's (Kevin McKidd) doorstep.
