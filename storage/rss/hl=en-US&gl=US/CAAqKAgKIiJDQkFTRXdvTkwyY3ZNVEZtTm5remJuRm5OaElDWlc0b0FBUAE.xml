Next year, Congress will look very different — in a good way. The midterms swept in a historic new class of diverse lawmakers who are due to dramatically reshape the centuries-old government body and transform not only the kinds of policies that end up being prioritized but also how Congress actually functions on a day-to-day basis. The incoming class of lawmakers now has a record-breaking number of women, people of color, and LGBTQ representatives — and they’ve already begun to shake things up.

A young outspoken woman who defines herself as “an educator, an organizer, a working-class New Yorker,” Ocasio-Cortez has positioned herself as an outsider who isn’t afraid of speaking truth to power. While her radical political positions – from abolishing ICE to Medicare for all – is responsible for some of that publicity, her fashion choices have also drawn a lot of scrutiny. “I’ll tell you something,” Washington Examiner reporter Eddie Scarry tweeted on Nov. 16, “that ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.fastcompany.com">Fast Company</source></item><item><title>Bush remembered on Capitol Hill for foreign-policy legacy - MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bush-remembered-on-capitol-hill-for-foreign-policy-legacy-2018-12-03</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEG-mpiNallW1-w4IJe08IEQqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowjujJATDXzBUwiJS0AQ</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 19:47:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bush-remembered-on-capitol-hill-for-foreign-policy-legacy-2018-12-03" target="_blank"&gt;Bush remembered on Capitol Hill for foreign-policy legacy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITOL REPORT By Robert Schroeder Ocasio-Cortez says ‘disagreements can be suspended’ to recognize power of presidency President George H.W.

Rick Loomis/Getty Images America can afford universal health care, but proponents still don’t have a specific plan. The US military budget is such a bloated monstrosity that it contains accounting errors that could finance two-thirds of the cost of a government-run single-payer health insurance system. All Americans could visit an unlimited array of doctors at no out of pocket cost. At least that’s a notion spreading on left-wing Twitter and endorsed and amplified by newly elected Rep.

Ways and Means is the House’s tax-writing body, and is generally packed with the most senior members of the House, including outgoing Rep. Joe Crowley, who Ocasio-Cortez defeated in November.
