And while the intent seemed to be good on the outside, critics claim that USAG resorted to bankruptcy in an effort to put a lid on investigations which may, in turn, uncover the truth and other cases tied up to the Nassar scandal, Manila Bulletin Sports reported. “It is a delay tactic designed to stop survi...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.ibtimes.com">International Business Times</source></item><item><title>Amid Ongoing Reorganization, U.S.A.

Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in Indianapolis. Kathryn Carson, the federation’s newly elected chairwoman, characterized the bankruptcy filing as a reorganization, “not a liquidation,” of the federation, which oversees the sport of gymnastics in the United States. More than 300 plaintiffs, including Olympic gymnasts, have sued U.S.A.

These were the standings at the end of the third rotation, with one to go.
