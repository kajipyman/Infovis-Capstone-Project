They are averaging 4.1 runs per game over their last three series after averaging 2.2 in the three series prior. However, changes may still be needed at the top of the order. Ever since the LA Angels traded for Yunel Escobar over the 2014 offseason, he has been the team's leadoff hitter. At 33 years old last season, he hit .304 with 64 runs and 39 RBI's. He also walked 40 times, proving his capability of getting on base for the Halo stars to hit him in. He also had a .937 fielding percentage.

If yesterday's 9-1 loss versus the Angels wasn't bad enough, the Astros got bad news this afternoon. Mike Fiers started last night's game in place of Lance McCullers who is dealing with arm fatigue. Fiers was removed from the rotation when the Astros traded for Justin Verlander. Yesterday, he got the opportunity to prove that he still belongs in the rotation. Instead, he lost control of the game and his anger. Typically a mild-mannered guy, Fiers did have words with A.J. Hinch last year.

Valbuena was pulled from Wednesday's spring training game citing hamstring tightness. The 31-year-old third baseman had hamstring surgery on the same leg last August and an MRI on Thursday confirmed that Valbuena had a Grade 1 strain. Valbuena signed a two-year deal worth $15 million with the Angels this past offseason that includes a mutual option for 2019.

The week was a big one for the Astros, as they managed to clinch the AL West title. For fantasy owners, some are clinching titles of their own, while others may still be chasing one. Astros hitters were not overly productive this week, but one pitcher, in particular, may have carried some owners. Here are the best and worst from the week. Best Hitter: George Springer Springer did very little against the Angels, notching just one hit in 12 at-bats.
