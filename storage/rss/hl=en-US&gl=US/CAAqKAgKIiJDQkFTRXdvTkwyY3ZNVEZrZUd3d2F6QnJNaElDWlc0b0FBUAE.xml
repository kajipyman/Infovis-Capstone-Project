The platinum rapper appeared in court in New York City after a summons was issued Oct. 1 for misdemeanor reckless endangerment and assault. Her lawyer has said she didn't harm anybody. Police said Cardi B and her entourage were at the club around 3 a.m. when she argued with a 23-year-old bartender.

Sometimes it's "I was on set, and my manager called." Most of the time, because the noms are announced around 5:00 a.m. PT, it's "I was asleep, and my manager called." For Cardi B, who received five nominations, it was something entirely different. The Bronx born rapper went to court this Friday after a judge reportedly threatened to issue a bench warrant for her arrest. Cardi was released without bail. On her way out of the courthouse, a photographer told her that she'd been nominated for a Grammy. ...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.refinery29.com">Refinery29</source></item><item><title>Cardi B Finally Appears In Court After Being Threatened With Arrest - OK!</title><link>https://okmagazine.com/photos/cardi-b-finally-appears-in-court-after-being-threatened-with-arrest/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiECcJixNHfNl796nn6FqwqdoqGAgEKg8IACoHCAow38LwATCyng8w1bSYAw</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 20:13:05 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://okmagazine.com/photos/cardi-b-finally-appears-in-court-after-being-threatened-with-arrest/" target="_blank"&gt;Cardi B Finally Appears In Court After Being Threatened With Arrest&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;OK!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardi B has been nominated for 5 Grammys and she’s not going to let anything get her down — not even her recent court date.

Allegedly, the Bronx native attacked two women, Baddie Gi and Jade of Angel’s Strip Club, because she believed her estranged husband Offset had an affair with one of them.

She had crystal-encrusted nails that sparkled with each minuscule hand movement.

(Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images for iHeartMedia) The Record of the Year Grammy is awarded to the producer and musicians who put out the song that people will remember decades from now as the inescapable, beloved, perfect (in some eyes, at least) track from one period in time. What was that piece of music for this past eligibility period? It’s going to be one of these eight songs, for sure.

Cardi B discovered that she was nominated for a Grammy yesterday moments after leaving court. The ‘Bodak Yellow’ star was appearing in court in relation to an incident where she allegedly attacked two bartenders at Angels Strip Club on August 29. Cardi B was arrested and charged on October 1 on suspicion of assault and reckless endangerment. - Read more: After a stiff start, Cardi B’s live return is a riot of personality, power, and passion Yesterday (December 7), Card...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nme.com">NME Live</source></item><item><title>Jameela Jamil and the Trouble With #NoFilter Feminism - The Atlantic</title><link>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/12/jameela-jamil-airbrushing-nofilter-feminism/577333/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHhSWpWjPg5VtZQS9TnMavAqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowm_EEMKAiMIpb</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 16:35:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/12/jameela-jamil-airbrushing-nofilter-feminism/577333/" target="_blank"&gt;Jameela Jamil and the Trouble With #NoFilter Feminism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the British actor Jameela Jamil took a familiar stand. For the BBC, she wrote with passion about an issue she’s championed for much of her career: the impossible beauty standards that shape how the world sees women (and how women see themselves). This time, though, Jamil made a particularly bold claim—that airbrushing images should be not just discouraged, but also illegal: “I think it’s a disgusting tool that has been weaponised, predominantly against women, and is responsible for so many more problems than we realise because we are blinded by the media, our culture, and...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.theatlantic.com">The Atlantic</source></item><item><title>The Grammys' Big 4 Are Full Of POC — But I'm Still Side Eyeing Them - Refinery29</title><link>https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/218879/grammys-2019-nominees-general-category-diversity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEI3Niu6DVeHrC-7nHCJAC_4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowqOXeCjDQ5dYBMJ3T0QM</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:10:44 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/218879/grammys-2019-nominees-general-category-diversity" target="_blank"&gt;The Grammys' Big 4 Are Full Of POC — But I'm Still Side Eyeing Them&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Refinery29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all of the traditional award shows — Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, Tonys — the Grammys are by far the most interesting to watch. I’m definitely more invested in my favorite musical artist than I am the movies or shows that struggle for my attention. Plus, an opportunity to catch a performance from the likes of Beyoncé or Childish Gambino is always a yes for me. However, I also appreciate the Grammys because they don’t have nearly as many issues with inclusivity as their stage and screen counterparts.

This year, the four biggest categories expanded to include eight nominees, which gives more artists the chance to make their dreams come true. Here are the nominees for Album of the Year in 2019.

The one woman nominated for Album of the Year, Lorde, was not invited to perform on the show — but all the men nominated were. Only one woman, Alessia Cara, won an award during the actual telecast. Women were shut out as songwriters, with no Record of the Year nominations, and in Producer of the Year, not only were there no nominations for women, but no woman had been nominated since 2004 (!!!).
