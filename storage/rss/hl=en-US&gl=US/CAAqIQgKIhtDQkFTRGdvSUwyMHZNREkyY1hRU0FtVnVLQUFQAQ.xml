Terance Gamble is asking the court to end the exception, which would prevent the federal government from charging him for the same weapons-possession crime that he already has pleaded guilty to under Alabama law.

The 14-year-old African American child from Chicago was visiting relatives in Money, Miss. After he supposedly flirted with a white woman, he was abducted, beaten, shot in the head and thrown into the Tallahatchie River with a 74-pound cotton gin fan tied to his neck with barbed wire. After an all-white, all-male jury acquitted two white men of his murder, they confessed their guilt and, protected against double jeopardy, freely lived out their lives.

(If the first prosecution led to a hung jury, reprosecution is allowed.) But the Court has long held that this only bars reprosecution by the same sovereign: The federal government may reprosecute a person after a state prosecution (and vice versa, and in principle the same for multiple states, in the rare cases where multiple states both have jurisdiction over the crime).

The reasoning goes like this: Trump could attempt to pardon people implicated in the Russia probe, whether Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, or someone else, thus preventing a trial or perhaps insulating himself from legal ramifications. The vast discretion affording the chief executive in the pardon power would allow the president to short-circuit accountability.
