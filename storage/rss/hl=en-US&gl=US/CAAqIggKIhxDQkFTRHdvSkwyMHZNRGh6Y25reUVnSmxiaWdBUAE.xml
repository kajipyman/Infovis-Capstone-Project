Bernie Sanders is laying the groundwork to launch a bigger presidential campaign than his first, as advisers predict he would open the 2020 Democratic presidential primary season as a political powerhouse. A final decision has not been made, but those closest to the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist suggest that neither age nor interest from a glut of progressive presidential prospects would dissuade...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.outsidethebeltway.com">Outside The Beltway - Mobile Edition</source></item><item><title>Why Does the Department of Education Want to Put Sexual Assault Survivors on Trial? - Glamour</title><link>https://www.glamour.com/story/department-of-education-title-ix-guidelines-put-survivors-on-trial</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiENrIhsAyWpbcY43jDd08VmwqGAgEKg8IACoHCAowiqLyCTC48XIwxansBQ</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 20:03:29 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/department-of-education-title-ix-guidelines-put-survivors-on-trial" target="_blank"&gt;Why Does the Department of Education Want to Put Sexual Assault Survivors on Trial?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Glamour&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know you are not on trial. You are not on trial,” said Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). It was September, and Sen. Harris was addressing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who’d come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify against then-nominee (now Supreme Court Justice) Brett Kavanaugh. It had already been a heartbreaking few hours—few weeks, really. So much of it blurs together, like a horror movie. But I’ll never forget the relief and pain I saw on Dr. Blasey Ford’s face when Sen. Harris reminded us all that holding people to account should never mean putting a survivor on trial.

Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), one of the Democratic Party’s possible 2020 presidential contenders, last month proposed an enormous tax cut for the middle class. Under Harris’s plan, the government would create a tax credit that matches each dollar an American family earns up to a maximum payment of $3,000, or $6,000 for a married couple. The benefit scales up the more money a family makes. A person who earns $2,000 would get a $2,000 credit; someone earning $1,000 would get a $1,000 credit; and so on down to $0. The benefit also would phase out at the t...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.washingtonpost.com">The Washington Post</source></item><item><title>Kamala Harris and Pramila Jayapal Introduce Federal Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights - Jezebel</title><link>https://theslot.jezebel.com/kamala-harris-and-pramila-jayapal-introduce-federal-dom-1830749943</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEEHuO3ORLegrsfflflMSAlcqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowlYECMLFMMOKjHg</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:33:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://theslot.jezebel.com/kamala-harris-and-pramila-jayapal-introduce-federal-dom-1830749943" target="_blank"&gt;Kamala Harris and Pramila Jayapal Introduce Federal Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Jezebel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Getty On Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris and Rep. Pramila Jayapal introduced a bill protecting domestic workers that, if passed, would become the first national legislation extending basic labor protections, including the right to unionize, protection from discrimination, and right to safe working conditions, to domestic workers. Most domestic workers, which are disproportionately women of color and immigrants, have been excluded from federal legislation that protects workers, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination only in workplaces with more than 15 em...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://theslot.jezebel.com">Jezebel</source></item><item><title>Harris faces backlash for comparing ICE to KKK - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/18/backlash-kamala-harris-ronald-vitiello-ice-questioning-cuomo-vpx.cnn</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEAqH9lNtS4KAfkt5KUCm9-cqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMI29pgU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2018 21:52:06 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/18/backlash-kamala-harris-ronald-vitiello-ice-questioning-cuomo-vpx.cnn" target="_blank"&gt;Harris faces backlash for comparing ICE to KKK&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN's Chris Cuomo leads a discussion on Sen.

Kamala Harris’ spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee in jeopardy. Absent some sort of fix, the Democrats will lose one slot on the Committee, and Harris, as the least senior Dem, will be the one to go. (“Spartacus” is next in line, but his slot is safe). Losing her seat would deny Harris, who almost certainly will run for president beginning next year, many a grandstanding opportunity. As the Washington Post observes, the Committee’s business will likely include a confirmation fight over a new Attorney General and vario...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.powerlineblog.com">Power Line</source></item><item><title>Kamala Harris could lose a key post - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/ip-kamala-judiciary.cnn</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEGjahqLYI-6JzV15Sbs2xVsqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMI29pgU</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:19:53 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/ip-kamala-judiciary.cnn" target="_blank"&gt;Kamala Harris could lose a key post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Washington Post article discusses the possibility of Sen.

But the Vermont senator was appearing at George Washington University as an author — not a presidential candidate. Sanders' new book, "Where We Go From Here," went on sale Tuesday, giving him a fresh opportunity to promote his ideas without going through the formality — yet — of launching another presidential campaign.

It was one of many such overtures the 23-year-old has fielded. "I'm hearing from them," said Turner, who managed Rob Sand's winning campaign for auditor. "They've been pretty respectful, congratulating me, but saying we'd love to talk to you more."
