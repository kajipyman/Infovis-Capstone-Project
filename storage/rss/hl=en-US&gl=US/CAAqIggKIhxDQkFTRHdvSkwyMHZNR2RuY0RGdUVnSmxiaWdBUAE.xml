Then on Friday, he announced that he was not going to host the event. Mr. Hart was in trouble because several of his tweets and comments — most of them several years old — used the word “gay” as an insult or were otherwise deemed homophobic.

It’s gotten so bad that earlier this week, in response to the fact that dozens of celebrities had turned down the Academy’s requests to preside over this year’s ceremony, The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed hosting the Oscars “the least wanted job in Hollywood.” That was, of course, mere hours before the Academy announced that comedian Kevin Hart had taken t...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.thedailybeast.com">The Daily Beast</source></item><item><title>Kevin Hart says he won't host Oscars after furor over homophobic tweets - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/entertainment/kevin-hart-oscars-step-down/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMEORMmFd8SJz83IWFyete4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMNHPpgU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 15:26:54 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/entertainment/kevin-hart-oscars-step-down/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Hart says he won't host Oscars after furor over homophobic tweets&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hart is stepping down from hosting the Oscars after homophobic tweets surfaced on Thursday.

Barely 48 hours later, he stepped down from that prestigious gig after failing to apologize (and unwisely doubling down on) homophobic remarks he had made in the past.

On Thursday (Nov. 6) night, Kevin Hart announced that he was stepping down from his hosting gig at the 2019 Academy Awards, less than two days after he was initially announced. The reason for his decision: intense backlash from recently unearthed homophobic tweets dating back nearly a decade.
