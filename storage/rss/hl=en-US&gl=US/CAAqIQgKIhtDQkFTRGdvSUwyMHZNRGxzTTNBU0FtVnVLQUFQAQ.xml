But when it comes to the status of women in Hollywood, as Thursday's Golden Globe nominations suggested, it often feels like there's a step back -- or at least a pause -- for every step forward. A shortage of quality roles for women -- especially older women -- has been a longstanding concern in the movie business, prompting many actresses to migrate to television. Still, this year's roster of year-end films -- many chasing awards consideration -- has yielded what feels like an unusually strong crop o...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</source></item><item><title>“Vox Lux,” Reviewed: A Tale of Star Power That Misuses Natalie Portman’s Star Power - The New Yorker</title><link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/vox-lux-reviewed-a-tale-of-star-power-that-misuses-natalie-portmans-star-power</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMpMQxqOLgqlZHzWP1EcPM4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowjMqjCjCJhZwBMKHSywM</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 23:53:15 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/vox-lux-reviewed-a-tale-of-star-power-that-misuses-natalie-portmans-star-power" target="_blank"&gt;“Vox Lux,” Reviewed: A Tale of Star Power That Misuses Natalie Portman’s Star Power&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its extremes of experience and banal slightness of content, Brady Corbet’s rock-world melodrama “Vox Lux,” portentously labelled “A Twenty-First Century Portrait,” is an exemplary latter-day entry in the realm of cinematic camp. Corbet’s direction is sober, sombre, earnest, restrained; the film is heavy with allusions to historic events, such as the killings at Columbine High School and the 9/11 attacks, which define the movie’s tone and set the plot in motion. In a way, Corbet is dealing with great issues and making a major display of taking them very seriously.

Jessica Simpson has taken exception to something Natalie Portman has said about her.

But the two share one similar quality — they defy their genre. Both titles, released by New York-based distributor, Neon, were spotlighted back-to-back this evening at Contenders. “My previous film was about the events leading up to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and after that, I decided to return to America, where I’m from, and make a film about the events that define the 21st century,” said Corbet, who shared the stage w...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://deadline.com">Deadline</source></item><item><title>The Week in Arts: ‘Vox Lux,’ Miami Basel, ‘Mrs. Maisel’ - The New York Times</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/vox-lux-art-basel-mrs-maisel.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEMuzFrDe2BQ9AyXwtJsqFIUqFwgEKg8IACoHCAowjuuKAzCWrzwwhoEY</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2018 13:00:07 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/vox-lux-art-basel-mrs-maisel.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Week in Arts: ‘Vox Lux,’ Miami Basel, ‘Mrs. Maisel’&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Film: Natalie Portman’s Tortured Diva in ‘Vox Lux’ Dec. 7. Brady Corbet was 10 in 1999, when the Columbine High School massacre ripped through the American psyche. Sixteen years later, he was living with his wife and infant son in Paris, while editing his feature directorial debut, “The Childhood of a Leader,” when terrorists attacked the Bataclan and other sites around the city. Corbet’s new film, “Vox Lux” — what he calls a “21st-century portrait” — begins with a 1999 school shooting in Staten Island, N.Y., and a steely focused 13-year-old survivor: Celeste (Raffey Cassidy), who in the tr...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</source></item><item><title>Paris Hilton's Ex Chris Zylka Focusing on Acting Now That He's Single - TMZ</title><link>http://www.tmz.com/2018/11/22/paris-hilton-ex-boyfriend-chris-zylka-acting-career-engagement-split/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEKFwegxqfD39YhefDfVBPTgqFQgEKgwIACoFCAowwGUwkAMwgO7lBQ</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 08:40:00 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/11/22/paris-hilton-ex-boyfriend-chris-zylka-acting-career-engagement-split/" target="_blank"&gt;Paris Hilton's Ex Chris Zylka Focusing on Acting Now That He's Single&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;TMZ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paris Hilton's ex is back to calling his own shots now that he's riding fast in the single lane ... first order of business -- breathing life into his acting career.

His début feature, “The Childhood of a Leader” (2015), set in the funereal wake of the First World War, was about a boy who looks like Christopher Robin but whose behavior would get him expelled from the Hundred Acre Wood.
