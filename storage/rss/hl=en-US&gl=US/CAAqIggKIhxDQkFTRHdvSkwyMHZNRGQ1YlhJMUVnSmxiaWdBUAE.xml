Hotel Transylvania 3, an animated family film from Sony featuring the voices of Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, and Andy Samberg, opened to $44 million domestically, easily winning first place. The film scored the second-best opening for the franchise, topping the original 2012 film’s $42 million.

However, she's not the only artist releasing new music. Her ex Mac Miller, from whom she split shortly before entering into the Pete Davidson whirlwind, has finally broken his silence. While Miller's new single, "Self Care," doesn't address the situation directly, it does have some lyrics that certainly hint to Grande's change of heart. But before we get into that, so much more happened with the couple of the summer this week that it's hard to know where to begin.

In an interview with Clevver News pegged to Hotel Transylvania 3, Gomez was asked how her vampiric character Mavis might feel about the quick engagement between the "No Tears Left To Cry" songstress and the Saturday Night Live star.
