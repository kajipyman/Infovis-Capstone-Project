Leadership of the National Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees (NCASEF), which represents owners of nearly 7,000 store locations, is also telling its members to skip the event. NCASEF contends that the home office earns money from exhibiting vendors for the annual trade show but franchisees do not benefit from that influx of capital.
