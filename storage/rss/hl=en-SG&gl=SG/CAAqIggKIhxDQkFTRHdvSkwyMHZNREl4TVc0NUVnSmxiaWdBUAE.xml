Ananthalakshmi KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim tried to ease a rift within the ruling alliance on Sunday after differences erupted between their supporters over cabinet positions. The four-party alliance scored a historic victory in Wednesday's general election over the long-ruling Barisan Nasional government, but the emergence of a rift so soon is raising questions about the unity of what was always an unlikely coalition. In a statement from his hospital bed, Anwar said he had told members of hi...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.reuters.com">Reuters</source></item><item><title>Mahathir bars predecessor from leaving Malaysia amid probe - The Associated Press</title><link>https://apnews.com/23539b2a2e1c48fb9a4cb71655948911</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEF1RpL53zgALNtmeVBhCGC0qGAgEKg8IACoHCAowhO7OATDh9CgwvaadAg</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2018 01:27:48 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/23539b2a2e1c48fb9a4cb71655948911" target="_blank"&gt;Mahathir bars predecessor from leaving Malaysia amid probe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia's new leader, Mahathir Mohamad, said he barred his scandal-tainted predecessor and his wife from leaving the country to prevent them from fleeing from possible prosecution over a massive corruption scandal. A leaked flight manifesto showed that Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor were planning to leave on a private jet Saturday to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, fueling rumors that he was bolting the country days after a shocking electoral defeat that ended his coalition's 60-year grip on power.

Few doubt that Prime Minister Najib Razak's Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has ruled Malaysia for the six decades since independence, will triumph.

The country is gearing up for a general election that could be called any day. The de-registration is a major blow for Mahathir, 92, who is leading a campaign by a federal opposition alliance to remove Najib Razak, the prime minister.
