"We don't know what happened, the boat was never found, one of the boys was never found, police had a huge search, a sonar search and everything but they couldn't find the boat, so we have no idea what happened," Ms Wagner said. 34-year old Magnus Ritter and a friend had split the cost of the five-metre runabout two months earlier. Ms Wagner said it did not have any obvious problems, but it lacked the required buoyancy of modern-day boats.
