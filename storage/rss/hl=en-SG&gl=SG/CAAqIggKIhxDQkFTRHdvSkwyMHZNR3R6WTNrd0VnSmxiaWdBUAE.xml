An anti-graft court in the Philippines has acquitted movie star-turned-politician Ramon Revilla Jr of plunder, the first verdict among several high-profile cases in the biggest corruption scandal to hit the country in the last decade. The Sandiganbayan court, however, on Friday convicted Revilla's aide Richard Cambe and his alleged co-conspirator Janet Lim-Napoles of the same crime.
