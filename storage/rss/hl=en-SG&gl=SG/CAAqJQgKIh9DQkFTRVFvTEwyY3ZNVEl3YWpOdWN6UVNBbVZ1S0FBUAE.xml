After one of its senior bankers pleaded guilty to charges that he helped orchestrate a vast fraud at Malaysia’s state investment fund, 1MDB, investors have started to fret about what sanctions the bank might face. Shares in the group fell more than 7 per cent on Monday and they are now down more than a quarter since March.
