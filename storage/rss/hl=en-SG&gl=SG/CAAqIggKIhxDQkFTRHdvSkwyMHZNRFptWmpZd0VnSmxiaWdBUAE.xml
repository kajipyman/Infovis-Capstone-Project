(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Trump brushed aside worries about trade with China on Friday, saying talks with Beijing are going well despite a blast of criticism from official Chinese sources over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive. Trump issued a tweet Friday morning saying only “China talks are going very well,” without providing any details. The tweet came in response to a rocky week on Wall Street, with markets see-sawing over fears that the two sides were at an impasse following Trump’s description of himself as “Mr. Ta...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Trump said to express irritation over Wall Street's negative review of China deal - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/trump-stock-market-china-irritation/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEKPITHX3hnLnD8P_YreJkwIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowocv1CjCSptoCMPrTpgU</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 21:51:51 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/politics/trump-stock-market-china-irritation/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Trump said to express irritation over Wall Street's negative review of China deal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;CNN&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has expressed anxiety about a dismal streak for the stock market over the past several days, telling advisers he is surprised a tentative deal he struck with Chinese President Xi Jinping hasn't gone over well with Wall Street, according to a person who has spoken with him. Ahead of Trump's meeting with Xi, held on Saturday evening in Argentina, some of Trump's top advisers told him the shaky markets were partly due to unease over a brewing trade war with China. That left Trump hungry to strike some sort of deal with Xi, people familiar with the matter said.

Ri Yong Ho’s trip was only announced on Tuesday, a few days after the Chinese president Xi Jinping held one-on-one talks with Donald Trump at the G20 summit in Argentina.

The arrest of a top executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei at the request of the US government has angered Beijing, alarmed investors and raised new doubts about the fragile truce that the leaders of the world's top two economies reached just days ago. "You have to see this as a significant escalation in the trade war," said Christopher Balding, a China expert at the Fulbright University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City.

"My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!" Trump tweeted.

But stark differences in the language used by Washington and Beijing in announcing the deal could spell trouble as both countries begin negotiations aimed at striking a permanent end to trade tensions. US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for more than two hours on the sidelines of the G20 meeting after months of tough talk on trade and tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.

The smiles and friendly handshakes exchanged between the two leaders on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Argentina contrasted sharply with the testy exchanges and thinly-veiled animosity that had for months defined the US-China relations amid a bitter tit-for-tat trade dispute.
