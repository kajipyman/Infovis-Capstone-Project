This disproportionate spike in use in expecting mothers in rural counties is alarming, arguing for urgent interventions to help women in remote areas.

Ashley, who grew up in a happy, financially stable home and was a jock, had begun drinking heavily in college, then experimented with what she calls party drugs — marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy. Eventually, she became addicted toheroin and other opiates. “In my mind it was like, ‘There’s no way I’m going to continue to get high when I’m pregnant.
