Prices grew by 0.3% in the year to November, down from 1.5% in October, according to the Halifax house price index, published on Friday. The last time the annual growth rate of house prices was as weak was in December 2012, when the UK economy was contracting. The average price of a UK home was £224,578 in November, 1.4% lower than the previous month.

The entire housing industry seems to have coalesced around one major explanation for today’s high home prices—home prices are high because new home builders haven’t built enough new homes since the Great Recession. The argument continues that homebuilders haven’t built enough new homes because local governments and residents won’t let the builders build more new homes due to zoning that is too restrictive and NIMBYism. It’s almost as if the entire housing industry is saying, “High home prices aren’t our fault and there’s nothing we can do about them.” This argument conveni...&lt;/p&gt;</description><source url="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</source></item><item><title>Exclusive: Venezuela's refinery woes send fuel imports soaring - internal documents - Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-imports-exclusive-idUSKBN1O422T</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CAIiEHauHrRslcBeEmWCGYRyOYIqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMOpn</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 16:58:46 GMT</pubDate><description>&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-imports-exclusive-idUSKBN1O422T" target="_blank"&gt;Exclusive: Venezuela's refinery woes send fuel imports soaring - internal documents&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Reuters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela this month plans to import over 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of refined products to ease domestic fuel shortages caused by hobbled refineries and need to prioritize exports, according to internal documents seen by Reuters.
