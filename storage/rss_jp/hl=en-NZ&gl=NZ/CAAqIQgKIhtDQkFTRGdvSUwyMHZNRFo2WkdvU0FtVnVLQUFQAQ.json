As he carefully explains how bees collect pollen and nectar from flowers, how they feed the pollen to baby bees, and how worker bees' wings beat an eye-watering 160 times a second in order to turn nectar into honey, the students at Hilton Primary School, in Perth's south, give him their full attention. \"The queen bee lays 2,000 eggs a day \u2014 that's one every 46 seconds,\" he tells them.

The Trump administration is scaling back contested school lunch standards implemented under the Obama administration including one that required only whole grains be served.
