Fury will challenge Wilder for the one world heavyweight title he has never held at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles. During a promotional tour ahead of the fight, Fury said: \"He hasn't got what he says he's got. I see fear in Deontay Wilder, I could sense his heartbeat through his suit. \"I know when a man's scared - Wilder's terrified of me. He's timid when he's around me - looks at the floor, doesn't make eye contact, all that sort of stu..."
