Amid butchers in bloodied coats, his dream of reversing Brexit seemed hopeless. Two years later, with the country in crisis over how or whether to leave the European Union, McGrory is feeling more confident that his campaign can help secure another referendum that he hopes would overturn the 2016 result. The idea of a second referendum has been gathering support from some senior British politicians and seems to have traction with sections of pub..."

But the judge at Hove Crown Court said the Romanian dish washer had escaped a prison sentence because he was so \"severely intellectually impaired\" that he would not cope behind bars.

The CBI director-general also warned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, claiming it would require \u201cdramatic decisions\u201d about what urgent supplies were able to arrive through Dover. The prime minister used her speech at the CBI conference in November to claim her new immigration system would stop EU ..."

Despite failing to be elected as an MP eight times, Mr Farage has a claim to being the most effective British politician since Tony Blair. Now he has quit the party he led on and off for a decade.
