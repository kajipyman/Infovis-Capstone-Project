They diversified universities tuition revenue, but over time they began to become a larger, and larger share of it. Only 4% of student visas, just under 12,000, went to citizens of Mainland China in 1997. But as the market opened, and China\u2019s middle class grew and prospered, many more Chinese students wanted and could afford to study in America.
