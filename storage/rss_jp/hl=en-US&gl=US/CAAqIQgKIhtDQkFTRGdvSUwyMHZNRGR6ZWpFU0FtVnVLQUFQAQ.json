Now, an unusual filing by one of the nation\u2019s most prominent appellate lawyers has given him and his colleagues a chance to prove it. Tom Goldstein, a prominent appellate lawyer and the co-founder of SCOTUSblog, is currently representing Barry Michaels in a Second Amendment case challenging the constitutionality of the federal government\u2019s ban on firearm ownership for convicted felons.

In fact, he broke two laws, since both Alabama and the federal government bar people with felony records from owning guns. Does that mean Gamble committed two offenses?
