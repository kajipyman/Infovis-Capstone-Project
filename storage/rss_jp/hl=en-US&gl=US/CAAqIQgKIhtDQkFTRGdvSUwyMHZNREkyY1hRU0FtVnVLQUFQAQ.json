And yet Terance Gamble is sitting in prison today because he was prosecuted separately by Alabama and the federal government for having a gun after an earlier robbery conviction. The Supreme Court is considering Gamble's case on Thursday, and the outcome could have a spillover effect on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
