Deval Patrick of Massachusetts will soon announce he won't launch a 2020 presidential campaign, according to three sources familiar with his plans. They did not say why he decided against a run. A formal announcement was delayed as the country observed a day of mourning for President George H.W. Bush, one source said. News of Patrick's plans was first reported by Politico. Patrick, 62, served two terms as governor, from 2007 to 2015, was assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Clinton administration and since leaving the governor's office has ..."

The meeting and subsequent comments fueled speculation that O\u2019Rourke is preparing for a 2020 presidential run.

At the time, the path seemed fairly clear: The former Massachusetts governor could run as Obama had, on unifying optimism, progressive politics, and a strong connection to the black voters who make up a pillar of the primary electorate. Clinton\u2019s team was, Darren Sands reported, quietly afraid of him. And the results of that election left Patrick intensely frustrated. One reason for that is obvious: Hillary Clinton was a far wea..."
