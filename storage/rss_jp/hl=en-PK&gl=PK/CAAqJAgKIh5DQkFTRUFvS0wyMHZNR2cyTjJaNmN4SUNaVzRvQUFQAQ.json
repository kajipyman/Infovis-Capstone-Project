The first of three Tests in the series begins on December 26 at Centurion. Also back in the squad are openers Fakhar Zaman, who missed the Test series against New Zealand with a knee injury, and Shan Masood, who comes in following the Test retirement of Mohammad Hafeez. Mohammad Rizwan, who has previously played one Test in Hamilton in November 2016, has also been included as the second wicketkeeping option behind captain Sarfraz Ahmed. Hafeez apart, Pakistan have left out of..."

After a brisk start pursuing New Zealand's 274, Azhar Ali and Haris Sohail, and then Azhar and Asad Shafiq, toiled for the last 49 overs of the day, adding just 78 runs to the tally during that period. However, with only three wickets lost and trailing by 135, Sarfraz Ahmed may feel his side is slightly ahead two days into this deciding Test match in Abu Dhabi.

In many ways the hosts have stayed true to their reputation of blowing hot and cold, epitomised by the dramatic batting collapse in the first Test and an equally compelling win, orchestrated by a spell of legspin bowling that had all the necessary elements of a magic trick - drift, drop and turn. But you wouldn't want to clap yet, because New Zealand have shown an eye for picking up clues, evidenced by a much-improved second-innings batting effort in..."

Equally, it was a day that Kane Williamson looked to have salvaged for his side with a phenomenally gritty partnership alongside BJ Watling, who finished unbeaten on 42 off 180 balls, having come in to bat all the way back in the first session. In the end, it was perhaps a day that concluded with as little to separate the sides as there had been at the toss, ..."
