After a brisk start pursuing New Zealand's 274, Azhar Ali and Haris Sohail, and then Azhar and Asad Shafiq, toiled for the last 49 overs of the day, adding just 78 runs to the tally during that period. However, with only three wickets lost and trailing by 135, Sarfraz Ahmed may feel his side is slightly ahead two days into this deciding Test match in Abu Dhabi.

In many ways the hosts have stayed true to their reputation of blowing hot and cold, epitomised by the dramatic batting collapse in the first Test and an equally compelling win, orchestrated by a spell of legspin bowling that had all the necessary elements of a magic trick - drift, drop and turn.
