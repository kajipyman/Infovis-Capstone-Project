India finished the day on a respectable 9-250 after it looked like they may have been skittled for a sub-par score. A spectacular catch by Usman Khawaja to dismiss Indian hero Virat Kohli was the highlight of the day for the Australians, while first drop Cheteshwar Pujara proved his mettle for the tourists, scoring a dogged century. It was his third ton against Australia but first in Australia, and the inn..."
