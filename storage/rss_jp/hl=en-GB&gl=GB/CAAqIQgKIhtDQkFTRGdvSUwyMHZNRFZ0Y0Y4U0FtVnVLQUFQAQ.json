When it comes to choosing which pupils to accept for a highly prized place at Oxbridge, pedigree is everything. The Sutton Trust has discovered that just eight elite secondary schools send the same number of pupils to Oxford and Cambridge as three quarters of all the other schools in the UK.

By contrast, some 2,900 schools and colleges, equating to three quarters of all further education centres in the UK, saw just 1,200 of their students accepted to Oxbridge in the same timeframe.
