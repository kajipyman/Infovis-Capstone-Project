The announcement comes after the BBC also abandoned a proposed programme earlier this week, meaning there will be no televised debate between the two party leaders ahead of next week\u2019s parliamentary debate. It follows a week of discussions between political parties and rival broadcasters over the set-up of the debate and who would host it. Labour had backed ITV\u2019s proposed one-on-one format, but the prime minister preferred the BBC\u2019s later offer of an eight-way debate featuring smaller polit..."
