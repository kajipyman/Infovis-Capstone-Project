This is especially true of its fast-growing cities, where a change in climate patterns is threatening rapidly-expanding populations and investment opportunities, a new report shows. High birth rates and increasing rural-urban migration means Africa has 86 out of 100 of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities. At least 79 of those cities, including key political and commercial hubs, are faced with \u201cextreme\u201d risks due to climate change, claims new research from risk consultancy firm Verisk Maplecroft.

The worst riots in Paris in decades were sparked by higher fuel taxes, and French President Emmanuel Macron responded by scrapping them Wednesday. But taxes on fossil fuels are just what international climate negotiators, meeting in Poland this week, say are desperately needed to help wean the world off of fossil fuels and slow climate change. \u201cThe events of the last few days in Paris have made me regard the challenges as even greater than I thought earlier,\u201d said Stanford University environmental economist Lawrence Goulder,..."

Greenhouse gas emissions worldwide are growing at an accelerating pace this year, researchers said Wednesday, putting the world on track to face some of the most severe consequences of global warming sooner than expected. Scientists described the quickening rate of carbon dioxide emissions in stark terms, comparing it to a \u201cspeeding freight train\u201d and laying part of the blame on an unexpected surge in the appetite for oil as people around the world not only buy more cars but also drive them farther than in..."
