Think of it: One of the most famous people in the world is panning religion. \u201cThe word God is for me nothing but the expression of and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends,\u201d the message reads. \u201cNo interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change anything about this.\u201d That is only 239 characters, including the spaces, periods and commas, well short of the 280-character limit for a tweet.
