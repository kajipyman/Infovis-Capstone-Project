With that in mind, and contemplating the Democrats\u2019 return to power in the House of Representatives, here\u2019s a little thought experiment. Suppose we did have a parliamentary system. How many political parties would we have? And what can this thought experiment tell us about the nature of our two parties and the dysfunction we see daily? Before we start, I sho..."

Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, will make the biggest cut. Russia, which is not an OPEC member but is an increasingly important factor in global oil markets, will account for much of the rest. The agreement on cuts, which were deeper than expected, capped two days of meetings focused on a growing oil glut that had caused prices to drop by roughly a third since ea..."
