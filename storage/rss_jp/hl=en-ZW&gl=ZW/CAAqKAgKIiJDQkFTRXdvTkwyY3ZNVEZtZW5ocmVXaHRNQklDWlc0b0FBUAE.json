A figure of a direwolf is covered in ice (probably representing House Stark), then a miniature dragon is frozen (a reference to House Targaryen or possibly zombie dragon Viserion). Fire engulfs a lion figure (a nod to House Lannister), and at the end of the clip, the two elements clash in the middle, likely representing a pretty epic battle in the series\u2019 final season. ..."
