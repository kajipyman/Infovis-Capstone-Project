In the days since the New York Timesdetailed Facebook\u2019s efforts to use antisemitic language to smear political opponents, one question has been whether Clegg will actually show for work in January, when his job starts. Why would someone with such a sterling r\u00e9sum\u00e9 want to clean such a disgusting mess? Yet Facebook executives may have chosen the perfect man for the task.

There seems to be mounting opinion linking the increase in populism around the world with the popularization of a technology that within a few years has come to monopolize a good part of the time, the thoughts and even how we consume news: the social networks. The relationship between populism and social networks cover more aspects than are usually considered. The awareness of some politicians that social networks, oriented to marketing and hyper-segmented campaigns, offer the perfect way to spread their message is only one facet. Figur..."
