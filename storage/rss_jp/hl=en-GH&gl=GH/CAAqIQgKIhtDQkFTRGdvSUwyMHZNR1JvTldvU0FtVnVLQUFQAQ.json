Wildlife crime investigators filmed the video to expose how the world\u2019s most-trafficked mammal is being driven to extinction by ruthless black-market operators who exploit both local communities and beliefs in fake medical treatments. Secretly captured by an undercover researcher on their mobile phone in India, the clip shows the pangolin clinging for life in a hollowed-out tree as its tail is tugged.
