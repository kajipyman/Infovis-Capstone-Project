International benchmark Brent crude fell below the $60 a barrel mark, down 3.2 per cent at $59.61 by the London morning. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was down 2.9 per cent at $51.33. The latest slide follows a tumble of almost 30 per cent since early October. The looming prospect..."

The 60-year-old is typical of Libya's once well-to-do middle class, impoverished by high inflation and devaluation during years of conflict in what used to be one of the Arab world's wealthiest countries. In contrast, armed groups whose commanders cruise Tripoli's potholed streets in luxury cars have become rich by forcing authorities to hire them and grant them cheap dollars they can change on the black market for a premi..."
