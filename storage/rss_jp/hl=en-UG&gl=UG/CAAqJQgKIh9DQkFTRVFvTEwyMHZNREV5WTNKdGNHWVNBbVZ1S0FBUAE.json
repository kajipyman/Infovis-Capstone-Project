Rarely though, does Far Cry pick up its narrative threads, preferring to share its themes and systems than storylines. New Dawn, though, picks up where previous game Far Cry 5 left off. Well, sort of. Without getting too far into the spoilery specifics, one of the finales of Far Cry 5 sees the outbreak of global nuclear war. T..."
