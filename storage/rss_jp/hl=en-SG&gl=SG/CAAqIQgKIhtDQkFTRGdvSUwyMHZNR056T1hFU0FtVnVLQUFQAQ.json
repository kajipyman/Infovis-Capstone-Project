But despite some lofty goals, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise in the South Pacific nation and could do so for years to come. And the country faces some unusual challenges with half of those emissions coming from farm animals. New Zealand Climate Change Minister James Shaw, who will travel to Poland on Sunday to attend U.N. climate talks, said in an interview with The Associated Press that he expects emissions to peak by 2025 and only then start to decline. \"We have not bent the ..."
