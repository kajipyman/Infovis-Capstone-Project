Nationwide, between 2008-2009 and 2014-2015, the proportion of babies born exposed to amphetamines - mostly meth - doubled from 1.2 infants for every 1,000 hospital births to 2.4 infants out of every 1,000 hospital births, the study found.

His attempted humour was lost on human rights activists who denounced the quip as disrespectful to the families of drug users, dealers, and innocent bystanders who have been gunned down in the name of tackling illegal drugs since Mr Duterte rose to power in June 2016.
