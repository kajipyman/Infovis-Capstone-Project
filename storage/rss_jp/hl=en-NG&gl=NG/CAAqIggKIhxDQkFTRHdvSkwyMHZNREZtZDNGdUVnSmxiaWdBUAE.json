The fifth tier team ensured a replay against the League Two side, despite the fact their manager Sam Ricketts was told to stay away from the match following speculation that he is set to be appointed as John Askey\u2019s replacement at Shrewsbury Town. Anthony Wordsworth\u2019s sublime goal helped AFC Wimbledon see off non-league Halifax and book their spot in the draw.
