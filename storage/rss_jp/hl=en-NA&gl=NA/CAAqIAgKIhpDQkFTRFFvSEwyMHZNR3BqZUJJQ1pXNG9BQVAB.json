Christie\u2019s auction house in New York stated on Tuesday afternoon that the letter, including the buyer\u2019s premium, fetched $2.89m under the hammer. That was almost twice the expected amount. The one-and-a-half-page letter, written in 1954 in German and addressed to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, contains reflections on God, the Bible and Judaism. Related: Einstein was a genius of physics.

Given the great cosmic distances and enormous masses at play, arrival times can differ by as little as hours or as much as decades between images, yet light itself is clearly experiencing the effects of gravity, even though it has no mass of its own. When Newton first proposed the law of universal gravitation, it marked the very first time that we realized the same rule governing how objects fell on Earth also governed how they moved and attracted one another ..."

Sure, science is a process of continual, never-ending updates, but it\u2019s a slow, gradual exercise that creaks and groans forward through the years, decades, and even centuries. If a headline is telling you that a major new discovery will completely change our paradigms, it\u2019s probably wrong.
