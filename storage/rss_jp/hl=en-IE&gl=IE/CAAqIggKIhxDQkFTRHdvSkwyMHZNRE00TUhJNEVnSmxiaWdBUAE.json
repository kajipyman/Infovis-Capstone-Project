The 32-year-old is out of contract with the IRFU in November 2019 and while Kearney has no intention to retire, suggested he could be open to the possibility of earning one bumper pay cheque in France before calling time on his playing career.

An insipid weekend of PRO14 action hasn't removed the remnants of the international window and the ongoing ramifications of the Ireland coaching situation from the agenda, so when Rob Kearney sits down at the top of the room the focus soon turns to the national questions.
