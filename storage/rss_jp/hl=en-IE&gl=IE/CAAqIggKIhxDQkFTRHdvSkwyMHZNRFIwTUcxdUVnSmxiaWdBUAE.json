The issue of broadband infrastructure has been examined as far back as the late 1990s with various governments commissioning reports. They generally reached the obvious conclusions that there was a deficit of broadband in the regions outside of Dublin which affected enterprise development, including foreign direct investment. However, filling that gap in the market wouldn't be straight-forward. State interventi..."
